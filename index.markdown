# Course Description
--- 
**CORE-UA.109.01, Quantitative Reasoning: Mathematics and Computing**

This course teaches key mathematical concepts using the new Python programming language. The first part of the course teaches students how to use the basic features of Python: operations with numbers and strings, variables, Boolean logic, control structures, loops and functions. The second part of the course focuses on the phenomena of growth and decay: geometric progressions, compound interest, exponentials and logarithms. The third part of the course introduces three key mathematical concepts: trigonometry, counting problems and probability. Students use Python to explore the mathematical concepts in labs and homework assignments. No prior knowledge of programming is required.<br>

Note that you should not be taking this course if you took more advanced math or programming courses. The list of courses that satisfy the Quantitative Reasoning requirement can be found [here](http://core.cas.nyu.edu/page/exemptionsprofexams#quantitative)
