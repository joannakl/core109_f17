# `print()` function 

```python
print ("hello core109 - congratulations on running your first program" )
print ( 3 * 17 - 102/3 + 7 )
```

* `print` does what you might expect it to do: it prints some content to the screen/console

* `print` takes either a string (first case above) or a numerical value (second case above) as its arguments 
    * strigs are sequences of characters that start and end eihter with a single quote `'` or 
    with a double quote `"` 
    * when the numerical value given to the `print` function is a more complicated expression,
    the `print` function evaluates it first before the value is printed (so the `print` function first figures out what the value of `3 * 17 - 102/3 + 7` is and then prints `24`)

# more on `print()` function

__Can I print more than one _thing_ using `print()`?__ 

Sure ... just concatenate your _things_ with a comma, like this: 

--

```python
print ("my name is", "Joanna") 
```
This will concatenate the two strings first and then print the resulting string. 
    
--

```python
print ("The value of  3 * 17 - 102/3 + 7  is ",  3 * 17 - 102/3 + 7) 
```
This will concatenate the first string that contains a mathematical expression 
with the value of 24.0 that results from calculating expression after the comma.

--

__Can I concatenate more than two _things_?__

Absolutely!

... just don't overdo it, otherwise your code becomes harder to read.

# `print()` examples 

```python
print("Line 1")
``` 

.output[ 
```
Line 1
```
]


This is just a regular print statement and its output. 

---

# `print()` examples:  `end='' `

```python
print('Line 2, part 1') 
print('Line 2, part 2') 
  
``` 

.output[
```
Line 2, part 1
Line 2, part 2
```
]

I wanted for these two strings to be printed on a single line!

What happened? 

--

* `print` function automatically adds a newline character at the end of the printed text 
* we can change that by telling it to use a different end of line character(s)

.left-column2[
```python
print('Line 2, part 1', end='') 
print('Line 2, part 2') 
```
.output[
```
Line 2, part 1Line 2, part 2
```
]
]


.right-column2[
```python
print('Line 2, part 1', end='***') 
print('Line 2, part 2') 
```
.output[
```
Line 2, part 1***Line 2, part 2
```
]
]


---

# `print()` examples: `sep=''` 
## 

```python
print("My name is ", "Joanna.") 
print("I am learning", "Python.") 
  
``` 

.output[
```
My name is  Joanna
I am learning Python
```
]


How do these two statements differ? 

--

* the first one has an extra space between "is" and "Joanna"
* `print` adds spaces between the elements of the comma-separated lists of its arguments automatically

We can change this behavior by specifying a different separator: 


```python
print("My name is ", "Joanna.", sep="")    #do not use any separator 
print("My name is", "Joanna.", sep="***")  #use three stars as a separator 
print("I am learning", "Python.", sep="  !  ")  #use spaces and a ! as a separator
```
.output[
```
My name is Joanna.
My name is***Joanna.
I am learning  !  Python.
```

# variables

* Variables are like little "buckets" or "containers" that can store information.

* You can create a variable by using the following syntax:

    __`variablename = somedata`__

    Examples:
    
    `speed = 5` <br>
    `myname = 'Kate'`
        
* The '=' symbol is called the __assignment operator__ and will cause Python to store the data on the right side of the statement into the variable name printed on the left side.

# variables - example 

```python
num1 = 57   #assign a value of 57 to variable named num1
num2 = 89   #assign a value of 89 to variable named num2

#calculate the sum of the values stored in num1 and num2
sum_of_nums = num1 + num2   

```
* this program does not have any output (why?)

* first the values are saved in variables called `num1` and `num2` and then
the sum of those values is saved in another variable called `sum_of_nums` 

---
# why variables? 

```python
num1 = 57   #assign a value of 57 to variable named num1
num2 = 89   #assign a value of 89 to variable named num2

#calculate the sum of the values stored in num1 and num2
sum_of_nums = num1 + num2   

```

Why do we need those variables instead of just using the numbers themselves 
to calculate the sum? 

--

* we might want to perform other operations on the same numbers - dealing with variables
guarantees (almost) that we can use the same exact values for each operation, 
for example
```python
diff_of_nums = num1 - num2 
product_of_nums = num1 * num2 
``` 
* we might want to change the value of the number that we are working with, for example, 
    * after we wrote the entire program using 57 in thirteen different places, we realized that 
    we really wanted to use 58
    * if the value is stored in a variable, we only need to change one line of code; if not, we 
    have to search for all different locations of 57 and replace them with 58

# `input()` function

```python

name = input("Hello! What is your name? ");
print ("Hi " + name + "! It is lovely to meet you!\n");

num_of_programs_written = input ("How many programs have you written " + 
        "in your life? ")
print ("Wow " + num_of_programs_written + 
        "!!! That's a good number.")

```
--

* the `input()` function takes __a prompt__ as its argument - it is simply used to tell the 
user what it is that the program wants 

* the `input()` function __returns__ (or gives back to the program) __the sequence of characters__ 
(also known as __a string__) that the user typed in response to the prompt  


* the value returned by the `input()` function can be saved in __a variable__: `name` and `num_of_programs_written` in the example above 
* this is another reason why we use variables - they store the values returned by functions

# `input()` function with numbers

Challenge: 
```python
fav_num = input("What is your favority number?")

print("Cool, I like ", fav_num, " as well.")
print("I also like twice that value:", 2 * fav_num) 
print("and I really like one more than that number:", 1 + fav_num) 
```

What happens when the above program runs and the user enters 7? 

--

.output[
```
What is your favority number? 7
Cool, I like  7  as well.
I also like twice that value: 77
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "python", line 6, in <module>
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
```
]

What went wrong? 

How do we fix it?

# `input()` function with numbers

```python
*fav_num = input("What is your favority number?")

print("Cool, I like ", fav_num, " as well.")
print("I also like twice that value:", 2 * fav_num) 
print("and I really like one more than that number:", 1 + fav_num) 
```

What is the value returned by the `input()` function?

* you may think that it is `7` - the number that the user entered

* ... but, remember that this function returns a sequence of characters that the user
entered, not a number

* the actual return value is `"7"` - a string containing the character 7 

* __we cannot do arithmetic on strings__ - at least not the kind of arithmetic that
we had in mind

# `input()` function with numbers

fav_num = input("What is your favority number?")

print("Cool, I like ", fav_num, " as well.")
print("I also like twice that value:", 2 * fav_num) 
print("and I really like one more than that number:", 1 + fav_num) 
```

How do we tell the program that we want to use the value entered by the user
as a number, not as a string? 

* we use `int()` function to convert a value to an integer (__integers__ are positive
and negative whole numbers) 


```python
*fav_num = int ( input("What is your favority number?") )

print("Cool, I like ", fav_num, " as well.")
print("I also like twice that value:", 2 * fav_num) 
print("and I really like one more than that number:", 1 + fav_num) 
```

.output[
```
What is your favority number? 7
Cool, I like  7  as well.
I also like twice that value: 14
and I really like one more than that number: 8

# conversion functions
]

# `int()`, `str()`, `float()`

* these functions all return a value or cause an error

* `int( x )` - converts a string or a number to an integer 

* `str ( x )` - converts the argument to a string 

* `float ( x )` - converts a string or a number to a floating point number 

--

Examples: 

```python
n1 = int("45")          # returns a number 45
n2 = int(-78.990)       # returns a number -78
#n3 = int("thirteen")   # causes an error 

f1 = float("-56.90876") # returns a floating point number -56.90876
f2 = float( 39 )        # returns a floating point number 39.0 
f3 = float("4.0 GPA")   # causes an error

# arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**` 

with numbers (whole numbers and decimal numbers) the above operators are
used to perform standard mathematical operations:
* `+  ` addition, for example `5.6 + 19` 
* `-  ` subtraction, for example `5.6 - 19`  
* `*` multiplication, for example `5.6 * 19`  
* `/` division, for example `5.6 / 19` 
* `**` exponentiation, for example `5.6 ** 19` 

```python
n1 = 5.6
n2 = 19 

print (n1, " + ", n2, " = ", n1 + n2 )
print (n1, " - ", n2, " = ", n1 - n2 )
print (n1, " * ", n2, " = ", n1 * n2 )
print (n1, " / ", n2, " = ", n1 / n2 )
print (n1, " ** ", n2, " = ", n1 ** n2 )
```

.output[
```
5.6  +  19  =  24.6
5.6  -  19  =  -13.4
5.6  *  19  =  106.39999999999999
5.6  /  19  =  0.29473684210526313
5.6  **  19  =  164275392349701.66
```

# string operators: `+`, `*`  

with string the above operators are
used to perform concatenation and replication:
* `+  ` concatenation 
    * combine two strings into a single one
    * both of the sides of the `+` operators need to be strings 
* `*  ` replication 
    * one operand is a string, the other is a positive integer
    * the string is repeated as many times as the number suggests 

```python
str1 = "crazy "
str2 = "hats"
str3 = str1 + str2 
str4 = 4 * str1
str5 = str2 * 3

print (str3 )
print (str4 ) 
print (str5 ) 
```

.output[
```
crazy hats
crazy crazy crazy crazy 
hatshatshats
```

# functions - summary 

* A "function" is __a pre-written piece of computer code__ that will perform a specific action or set of actions

* Python comes with a number of __built-in functions__, and you can also write your own (more on that later in the semester) 

* Functions always begin with a keyword (the __name of the function__) followed by a pair of parenthesis.
    Ex:  `print ()`, `input()`
    
* You can __pass one or more arguments__ into a function by placing data inside the parenthesis
    Ex:  `print ('Hello, World!')`
    
    * Different functions "expect" different arguments.  The print function, for example, expects printed text as an argument
    
* Functions may or may not __return a value__. 

    * Some functions simply perform some action. Ex. `print()` 
    * Other functions perform a computation and return its result to the user. Ex. `input()` 

* When you ask Python to run a function we say that you have __called the function__.
