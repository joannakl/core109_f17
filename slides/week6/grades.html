# program to get the exam scores from the user
 

Let's write a program to obtain the exam scores from the user.

- the user should be prompted for a next score until they enter -1

- the program should validate that the number entered is between zero and 100
(inclusive)

# calculating average score

- how do you calculate the average score? 

--

    $$average = \frac{grade_1 + grade_2 + ... + grade_n }{n}$$
  

- __mean__ is another word use to describe the average 

- __mean__ is a measure of central tendency 

--

--- 

- what does the __mean__ of exam grades tell us?

- how can this be used? 

- what are the possible issues? 

--

---  

- what letter grade should be associated with a score that is equal to the average grade? 

---

# median 

- __median__ is the middle score 

- algorithm for finding the median:
    
    - sort all grades from smallest to largest
    
    - find the middle score
        - if the number of grades is odd, the median is equal to the middle score
        - if the number of grades is even, the median is the average of the two middle 
        scores 

- __median__ is a measure of central tendency 

--

--- 

- what does the __median__ of exam grades tell us?

- how can this be used? 

- what are the possible issues? 

--

---  

- what letter grade should be associated with a score that is equal to the median grade? 

---
# range of values

- __smallest__ value in the range of grades

- __largest__ value in the range of grades 


- __range__ (__smallest__, __largest__) is a measure of dispersion  

--

--- 

- what do the  __smallest__ and __largest__ values of exam grades tell us?

- how can this be used? 

- what are the possible issues? 

--

--- 

- what letter grade should be associated with a score that is smallest / largest? 

---

# standard deviation  

- __standard deviation__ is ... 

- algorithm for finding the stadard deviation:
    
    - calculate the mean
    
    - find the difference between each score and the mean and square that difference
    
    - add all of the squares of differences together and divide the sum by the
    total number of grades
    
    - take a square root of the value in the previous step 

- __standard deviation__  is a measure of dispersion  

--

--- 

- what do the  __standard deviation__ value of exam grades tell us?

- how can this be used? 

- what are the possible issues?
