# let's start with an example 

Write a program that prints numbers from 0 to 9, each on a new line. 

--
.left-column2[
```python
print("0") 
print("1") 
print("2") 
print("3") 
print("4") 
print("5") 
print("6") 
print("7") 
print("8") 
print("9") 
```

.right-column2[
```python
for i in range(0,10,1):
    print(i)

- which of the two programs do you prefer? 

- which of them is easier to write?

- would your answer be the same if you needed to write a program
that printed values from 0 to 1000?

# examples of `for` loops

.left-column2[
```python
for num in [1,2,3,4,5]:
    print ("This will print 5 times")
```

Output: 
```
This will print 5 times
This will print 5 times
This will print 5 times
This will print 5 times
This will print 5 times
```

```python
primes = [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29]
num = 4
for prime in primes:
    print (num, "*", prime,

Output:
```
4 * 2 = 8
4 * 3 = 12
4 * 5 = 20

# examples of `for` loops

```python
available_toppings = ['mushrooms', 'olives', 'green peppers',
        'pepperoni', 'pinapple', 'extra cheese']
        
requested_toppings = ['mushrooms', 'sausage', 'Olives']

for topping in requested_toppings: 
    if topping in available_toppings :
        print ('Adding', topping, '.')
    else:
        print ("Sorry, we don't have", topping, ".") 

print("\nFinished making your pizza.\nEnjoy!") 
```

Output:
```
Adding mushrooms .
Sorry, we don't have sausage .
Sorry, we don't have Olives .

Finished making your pizza.
Enjoy!
```

# syntax
.center[
<img src="img/for_loop.png" width=90% alt="for loop syntax"> 
]

- the statements in the loop run multiple times

- each time the `variable` takes on a different value from the list 
`[value1, value2, etc]`

    - on the first iteration `variable` is equal to `value1`

    - on the second iteration `variable` is equal to `value1`

    - on the third iteration `variable` is equal to `etc`

# lists in Python

__Lists__ in Python are defined by the square bracket characters `[` and `]`.
Items in a list are separated by a comma.

There are several ways of creating a __list__ in Python. 

- enumeration: simply enumerate values for the list
inside square brackets; the values are separated by commans

    - `grades = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'f']`  
    - `primes  = [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29]`
    - `friends = ['Alice', 'John', 'Mary'] `
    - `random_things = [3.14, 'quiz3', 45, 'long weekend', 6.7]` 

--

- return value from a function: many functions return a list
when called; one such example is the `range()` function

    - `range(0,10,1)` returns `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8]`
    - `range(0,20,2)` returns `[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]`
    - `range(10)` returns `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8]`
    - `range(-10, 11, 5)` returns `[-10, -5, 0, 5, 10]`  

--

.center[What do you think the rules for this `range()` function are?]

---
# `range()` function 

- the __`range()`__ function lets you dynamically generate lists based on
criteria that you define 

    - well, technically `range()` function returns an iterable 
    not a list 

    - the `for` loop does not care which of the two it uses

    - in any other context, you can create the list out of an iterable using the `list()` function, for example `list(range(1,10,1))` 



---
# `range()` function 

- when __called with one argument `range( n )`__ it returns a list that
contains all the numbers starting from `0` up to (but not including) `n`
    - `range(5)` returns `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` 
    - `range(-5)` returns `[]` - an empty list 

--
    
- when __called with two argumets `range( n1, n2 )`__ it returns 
a list that contains all the numbers starting from `n1` up to 
(but not including) `n2` 
    - `range(2,7)` returns `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`
    - `range(-99, -95)` returns `[-99, -98, -97, -96]`
    
--

- when __called with three arguments `range(n1, n2, diff)`__ it returns 
a list that contains all the numbers starting from `n1` up to 
(but not including) `n2` in increments of `diff` 
    - `range(-10, 11, 5)` returns `[-10, -5, 0, 5, 10]`
    - `range(0, 10, 3)` returns `[0, 3, 6, 9]`
    - `range(1,1000,100)` returns `[1, 101, 201, 301, 401, 501, 601, 701, 801, 901]`
    - `range(0, -10, -2)` returns `[0, -2, -4, -6, -8]` 
    
--

- when __called with four arguments__ ...
    - it produces an error message: <br>
    `TypeError: range expected at most 3 arguments, got 4 `

# mixing loops and conditionals 

```python
for num in range(1,11,1):
    if num % 2 == 0 :
        print (num, "is even")
    else :
        print (num, "is odd")

- what will the above program produce? 

--

Output:

```
1 is odd
2 is even
3 is odd
4 is even
5 is odd
6 is even
7 is odd
8 is even
9 is odd
10 is even
```

# nesting loops

__nested loops__ are loop that are inside other loops  

```python
for num1 in range(1,11,1):
    for num2 in range (1,11,1):
        print (num1*num2,end="\t") 
    print()

```

- it's a multiplication table (although the labels for rows
    and columns are missing) 
- __challenge:__ modify the program to add labels to each row and column

#using loops to _accumulate_ values

What do you think this program does? 

```python
sum = 0

for num in range(1,101):
    sum = sum + num 
    
print (sum )  
```

--

Output
```
5050
```

- The program computes the sum of all the numbers from 1 to 100.

- We will often talk about variable like `sum` as an _accumulator_
because we _accumulate_ all the values from 1 to 100 in `sum`

# user provided number of repeats

- the user can determine the number of times some task is repeated

height = int(input('How tall do you want this ladder to be?'))

for i in range(height):
	print('========\n|      |')
```

.left-column2[
Interaction 1: 
```

# prime numbers? 

Write a program that prompts the user for a positive number. 
The program should determine if the number is a prime. 

__Prime__ numbers are the numbers that are divisible only by 1 and 
itself. For example 7 is prime since the only numbers that divide it
(without a remainder) are 1 and 7:

```
7 / 1 = 7.0             <===  no remainder 
7 / 2 = 3.5
7 / 3 = 2.33333333333
7 / 4 = 1.75
7 / 5 = 1.4
7 / 6 = 1.16666666666
7 / 7 = 1.0             <===  no remainder 
```

# average scores

Write a program that allows you to calculate average of your 
quiz grades. 
The program should prompt the user for 5 grades and then compute
their average (add all grades together and divide by 5). 
Assume that the scores are always between 0 and 10.

Version 2: add verification of the user input, i.e., check if the user
entered a score between zero and 10, and if not, print an error message

# stair steps

- Write a program that prints out the following pattern of characters:
```
++
++++
++++++
++++++++
++++++++++
++++++++++++
```
- Write a program that prints out the following pattern of characters:
```
              ++
            ++++
          ++++++
        ++++++++
      ++++++++++
    ++++++++++++
```
- Rewrite the above programs to take the number of rows in the pattern
from the user.

# divisibility testing


Write a program that asks the user to enter in an integer. 

The program should then find all numbers between 1 and 10,000 that are
evenly divisible by that number.

# fizz buzz

Write a program that prints out numbers 1 to 100 with the following exceptions:
- for multiples of three, print out "Fizz" instead of the number
- for multiples of five, print out "Buzz" instead of the number
- for multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”

Example output on the next slide.

---
# fizz buzz - output

```
        1
        2
        Fizz
        4
