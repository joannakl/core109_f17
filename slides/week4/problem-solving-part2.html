** or what is your money going to be worth tomorrow?**
<br><br><br>
- Each year things cost more than a year before.

- This is called __inflation__.

- U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics provides the inflation calculator

-  Using the inflation calculator we can find out what $100 of some past year is worth these days.

# inflation

- If you bought an item that cost $100.00 ten years ago, how much would you need to spend today for 
an equivalent item? (or what amount of money has the same __buying power__ as the $100.00 from a 
decade ago) 


- Guess: 

    - Can you guess what $100 from 2014 would be _equivalent to_ in 2017? 

    - How about $100 from 1998 (this is roughly when you were born, isn't it)?  

    - How about 1913 (the earliest year in the calculator)? 

---

#  why do we care about inflation? 

- Say you are one of the college graduates of 2015 and you get a job
paying $50,000 a year with the guaranteed annual increase of 2%.

- Are you really making $51,000 the following year?  

- Nominally yes, but it is not worth the same as $51,000 in the year that you were hired. 

---
#  correcting for inflation
**(this is a simple approximation; for a more complete analysis we would need to use the 
consumer price index)** 

What is the inflation rate?

- If the $100 in 2016 is equivalent to $101.63 in 2017 (according to the
inflation calculator from June 2016 to June 2017), then how can we figure out the inflation rate
from 2016 to 2017?  

    $$\\frac{ \\$101.63 - \\$100.00}{\\$100.00} = \\frac{\\$1.63}{\\$100} = 0.0163$$
  
    inflation rate: 1.63%  

Inflation is a negative rate, it decreases the value of money.

- Your salary of $51,000 in 2017 is worth only

    $51, 000 × (1 − 0.0163)=$50,168.70
    
    (if we think of 2016 as a baseline for the buying power of money). 
  
    Not a 2% increase! 

---
# inflation summary 
  
If the annual increase in one's salary is
    
- less than the inflation rate, the income effectively decreases 

- more than the inflation rate, the income effectively increases   

 
If an interest rate offered by a bank is 

- below the inflation rate, the bank account is effectively losing value 

- above the inflation rate, the bank account is effectively gaining value

#  electricity bills 

- You may or may not be paying electricity bills, but one day you will
and it is interesting to know how they work.

- If you use twice as much electricity in June as you did in February
is your bill twice as big (assume that the price is still the same)?

- If so, we could calculate the amount of the bill as follows (note
that electricity consumption is calculated in kilo-watt-hours, kwh):

.center[_cost in a given month = price per one kwh × number of kwh used_]
$$b( k ) = price × k$$

- (Note that the above formula will need to be adjusted to really
    represent the function that models electricity bills.)

#  electricity bills 

-   Lane Electric is a power supplier company. Their website has a nifty
    calculator that allows one to estimate the amount of the monthly
    bill (see <http://laneelectric.com/tools/bill-estimator/>. Let’s try
    to figure out if we can actually come up with a pattern.

   <table>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th align="center">kWh used</th>
    <th align="center">monthly price</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td align="center">25</td>
    <td align="center">$14.05</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td align="center">50</td>
    <td align="center">$16.10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td align="center">75</td>
    <td align="center">$18.15</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td align="center">100</td>
    <td align="center">$20.20</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

-   Can you figure out how much a single kWh of electricity costs?

    Work with a partner (or two) to see if you can come up with a formula. 

--

-   The answer does not seem to be straight forward, does it?

    But what if you knew that the same company will issue a
    bill for $12.00 per month even if you do not use any electricity?
    

---
#  electricity bills 

-   Here is the table again with the added column:

    <table>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th align="center">kWh used</th>
    <th align="center">monthly price</th>
    <th align="center">monthly price - $12.00</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td align="center">25</td>
    <td align="center">$14.05</td>
    <td align="center">$2.05</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td align="center">50</td>
    <td align="center">$16.20</td>
    <td align="center">$4.10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td align="center">75</td>
    <td align="center">$18.15</td>
    <td align="center">$6.15</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td align="center">100</td>
    <td align="center">$20.20</td>
    <td align="center">$8.20</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

-   Can you figure out the pattern now?

-   It seems that each 25 kWh of electricity costs exactly $2.05.

-   This means that 1 kW costs $2.05/25 or $0.082 or 8.2¢.

-   And the bill can be calculated as
$$ b(k) = 0.082 × k + 12.00 $$

What other bills _behave_ this way?

#  try it yourself: car rental 

- You are about to move and you need to rent a track to transfer all
    your things from the old place to the new place. You did your
    research regarding available rental places. Here is the information
    you collected:

    <table>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th align="left"> </th>
    <th align="center">Watertown</th>
    <th align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;U-Haul&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</th>
    <th align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</th>
    <th align="center">Enterprise</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td align="left">fixed cost</td>
    <td align="center">$79.00</td>
    <td align="center">$29.95</td>
    <td align="center">$29.95</td>
    <td align="center">$59.95</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td align="left">$ per mile</td>
    <td align="center">0.00</td>
    <td align="center">$1.39</td>
    <td align="center">$0.99</td>
    <td align="center">$0.59 <span>(after the first 100 miles)</span></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

- Which company should you use?

    -   for a very short move (just couple of blocks)?

    -   for a very long move (the East Coast to Alaska)?

    -   what about a medium size move, let’s say 35 miles

- What is the function for price for each of those companies (this
    should be a function of miles driven).

# Programming challenge

Revisit the salaries of graduates from 2016. 
- assume starting salary of $50,000
- assume annual percentage increase of 2%
Plot the salaries at the end of each year in the range 1 - 10.
Hint: you will need to figure out the function that calculates that salary
based on the given year number (we did that on the board last week). 

Now consider inflation.
- assume that the inflation for the next ten years will be 1.6% a year
Plot both, the salaries as calculated above and the salaries reduced by inflation.
