# picking lunch 


You have the following options at your favorite lunch place. How many days 
will you be able to eat there without repeating the same combination? 


.left-column2[
- sandwitch (pick one)
    - hamburger
    - grilled chicken 
    - fish
    - veggies 
- sides (pick one)
    - french fries
    - onion rings
    - salad
- drink (pick one)
    - tea
    - water
    - coke
    - sprite
    - milk

There are 4 choices for a sandwitch, 3 choices for a side and 5 choices
for a drink. 

Assuming you are willing to eat/drink everything on the menu,
there are <br>
4 `*` 3 `*` 5 = 60<br>
different meals that can be created.

NYU assigns unique id numbers to all of its students and employees. 

Each id starts with a letter 'N' and is followed by 8 digits.

- How many different unique id numbers can be generated using this model?

.below-column2[

- for each of the 8 digit positions, there are 10 different possibilities:
0, 1, 2, ..., 9 

- since there is only one possibility for the letter, there are no choices there

- this means there are <br>

    1 `*` 10 `*` 10 `*` 10 `*` 10 `*` 10 `*` 10 `*` 10 `*` 10 = 10^8 = 100,000,000 <br>

# license plates


Automobile license plates typically have a combination of letters ( 26 ) and numbers ( 10 ). Over time, the state of New
York has used different criteria to assign vehicle license plate numbers.

.center[
<img src="https://dmv.ny.gov/sites/default/files/styles/panopoly_image_original/public/Plates_2.png?itok=-1gvx8I1" width=80% alt="NYS license plate"> 
]

- From 1973 to 1986, the state used a 3-letter and 4-number code where the three letters indicated the county where the vehicle was registered. 
Essex County had 13 different 3-letter codes in use. How many cars could be
registered in Essex? 

- Since 2001, the state has used a 3-letter and 4-number code but no longer assigns letters by county. 
As of [2016 report](https://dmv.ny.gov/statistic/2016reginforce-web.pdf) New
York state had 11,256,778 vehicles registered. 
Is this coding scheme enough to register all of the vehicles in New York state?

# lucky id numbers 

What is the chance that a person is assigned an NYU id number that 
consists of all of the digits that are the same? <br>

For example, N11111111 or N44444444. 

--

- there are total of 100,000,000 possible id numbers

- how many id numbers have all the same digits?

--

    - 10 (the one with all 1's, the one with all 2's, ...) 

--

- so the chance of getting a number that has all the same digits (assuming all numbers are equally likely is: 10 / 100,000,000 which is one
in ten million 

<br><br>
.small[
Dsiclaimer: NYU probably does not assign the id numbers randomly; there are
are also other rules for what a valid id can be.

Figure out the answers to the following questions: 

- what is the chance that you both end up with exactly the same lunch?

- what is the chance that you both end up with a hamburger?

# probability summary 

__sample space__ - set of all possible outcomes

__event__ - subset of possible outcomes that we are interested in (those outcomes
are usually equally likely) 

The __probability of an event__ is then defined by the fraction calculated as the 
number of outcomes of an event divided by the total number of outcomes in the sample 
space. 

The __probability of two or more independent events__ is the product of 
the associated probabilities.  

(Two events are __independent__ if the occurrence of one does not change the probability
of the other occuring.)

# selecting a new car

Supposed a new car model comes with the following options:

- 3 choices of body style (2-door, 4-door, station wagon)

- 4 colors (black, red, silver, green)

- 2 choices of engine size (4 or 6 cylinder)

Answer the following questions: 

- how many different orders can be placed for the car? 

- if you select one of those possible car options at random,
what is the probability of getting a 4-door car? 

- if you select one of those possible car options at random, what is
the probability of getting a silver or a black car?

Suppose you are tossing 3 coins and want  2 heads.

- list all of the possible outcomes for tossing three coins (this is called
a sample space)

- list all of the possible outcomes for getting exactly two heads (this is called the
event)

- what is the probability of tossing 3 coins and getting exactly two heads? 

- what is the probability of tossing 3 coins and getting at least two heads?

Suppose you have a jar with 5 white marbles and 8 black marbles.

- what is the probability of drawing a black marble?

- what is the probability of drawing a white marble?

- add the two values from the previous questions? what value did you get?
is that reasonable?

- suppose you draw one marble, put it back in the jar and then draw another 
marble
    - what is the probability that both are black?
    - what is the probability that both are white?
    - what is the probability that the first is white and the second is black?

# what is a probability distribution? 


A __probability distribution__ is a collection of all outcomes of a random 
phenomenon together with their associated probabilities. 

Example: 

Probability distribution of rolling a fair six sided die:

- there are six possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

- each of them is equally likely, so the probability of each is 1/6 

The probability distribution can be presented in a table:


outcomes: | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6
----|--|--|--|--|--|--
probabilities:| 1/6 | 1/6 | 1/6 | 1/6 | 1/6 | 1/6

# two dice?

What is the probability distribution when rolling two fair six sided dice? 

--

- how many outcomes are there? 

- what is the probability of each outcome? 

- create the probability distribution table 


--

- there are 11 possible outcomes: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 

- there are 36 different combinations (since rolling 1 with the first die and 5 with the second, AND rolling 5 with the first die and 1 with the second are two different possibities) 


outcomes: | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10| 11| 12| 
----|--|--|--|--|--|--
probabilities:| 1/36 | 2/36 | 3/36 | 4/36 | 5/36 | 6/36 | 5/36 | 4/36 | 3/36 | 2/36 | 1/36 
combinations: | (1,1) | (1,2)<br>(2,1) | (1,3)<br>(2,2)<br>(3,1) | (1,4)<br>(2,3)<br>(3,2)<br>(4,1) | (1,5)<br>(2,4)<br>(3,3)<br>(4,2)<br>(5,1) | (1,6)<br>(2,5)<br>(3,4)<br>(4,3)<br>(5,2)<br>(1,6) | (2,6)<br>(3,5)<br>(4,4)<br>(5,3)<br>(6,2) | (3,6)<br>(4,5)<br>(5,4)<br>(6,3) | (4,6)<br>(5,5)<br>(6,4) | (5,6)<br>(6,5) | (6,6)

# expected value 

We talk about expected values in the context of numerical data (often
when talking about money).

The __expected value__ is the __mean of the probability distribution__
calculated as the sum of products of the outcomes and their respective 
probilities. 

_Example 1_

What would be the expected value when rolling one fair six-sided die? 

--

The probability distribution is:


outcomes: | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6
----|--|--|--|--|--|--
probabilities:| 1/6 | 1/6 | 1/6 | 1/6 | 1/6 | 1/6 

So the expected value is calculated as 

`1*1/6 + 2*1/6 + 3*1/6 + 4*1/6 + 5*1/6 + 6*1/6 = 21/6 = 3.5 `

--

_Example 2_

What would be the expected value when rolling two fair six-sided dice?

# rolling dice

- When rolling two dice, what is the probability that you get a 3 on the first die
and a number greater than 3 on the second? 

- When rolling two dice, what is the probability that the sum is greater than or
equal to 7, but less than 10? 

- What is the probability distribution and the expected value when rolling
one five-sided fair die? 

- What is the probability distribution and the expected value when rolling two 
five-sided fair dice? 

- You and a friend decide to play _gambling dice_. It costs $1.00 to play. If you roll a 5 or 6, you get a prize of $2.00 (one dollar profit). If you roll 
any other value, you win nothing (you lose one dollar). What is the expected value 
of your winnings/loses?

Calvin is taking a test using _Calvin's method_ which involves flipping a coin and putting _true_ for heads and _false_ for tails. Suppose that the test contains
10 questions. 

- what is the probability that he gets all ten questions right? 

- what is the probability that he gets none of the questions right?

- what is the probability that he gets one question right? 

- what is the probability that he gets nine questions right?  

- what is the probability that he gets seven questions right? 

- what is the probability distribution of all possible outcomes?

# _partially matching_ license plates

What is the chance that two people have license plates that have
the same three initial letters? <br>

For example, ABJ 9870 and ABJ 1245, or XYZ 3467 and XYZ 1239. 

--

- there are total of 175,760,000 possible license plates in NYS <br>
(26 `*` 26 `*` 26 `*` 10 `*` 10 `*` 10 `*` 10) 

- given a particular license plate with a particular three letter combination, how many other plates
start with those letters? 

--

    - 9,999 (10 `*` 10 `*` 10 `*` 10 - 1)

--

- so the chance of two people having the same letters in a license plate is 
10,000 / 175,760,000 = 1/17,576 (approximately one in seventeen thousand)
