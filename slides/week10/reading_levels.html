# readability score  

* __readability score__ is a number associated with a book that attempts to indicate the readability level of a book 

* what is (or should be) included in calculating readability of a book?

--
    
    * book length
    * sentence length
    * word length
    * number of syllables per word
    * word difficulty (simple words vs. hard/fancy words)
    * grammar 
    * plot structure 
    
--

* why do we care about readability score of books?

--
    
    * children use books to learn:
        * books that are too hard may discourage students from reading more 
        * books that are too easy do not challenge the students and may be boring 
        
    * second language learners use books to learn the language

# Fry Readability Formula 

* developed by Edward Fry

* for English texts (why do you think this matters?)

* how is it calculated:
    * determine the average number of sentences per hundred words (vertical axis)
    
    * determine the average number of syllables per hundred words (horizontal axis) 
    
    * find the point of intersection of those two values in the Fry Graph (next slide)

#  Flesch-Kincaid Index 

* developed by Rudolf Flesch and J. Peter Kincaid 

* developed for the United States Navy 
    * first used in 1978 for assessing difficulty of technical manuals 
    
* Pennsylvania was the first US state to require that automobile insurance policies are written with no higher level than
the ninth grade on the Flesch-Kincaid index 
    * this is now a standard across the country 
  
  
* the forumla used for calculation:   
    
$$0.39 \\left ( \\frac{\\mbox{total words}}{\\mbox{total sentences}} \\right ) + 11.8 \\left ( \\frac{\\mbox{total syllables}}{\\mbox{total words}} \\right ) - 15.59$$

* the result is a number that corresponds with a U.S. grade level 

* .small[Note: The lowest grade level score in theory is −3.40, but there are few real passages in which every sentence consists of a single one-syllable word. Green Eggs and Ham by Dr. Seuss comes close, averaging 5.7 words per sentence and 1.02 syllables per word, with a grade level of −1.3. (Most of the 50 used words are monosyllabic; "anywhere", which occurs eight times, is the only exception.) ]

# Dale-Chall  Readability Test

* developed by  Edgar Dale and Jeanne Chall  

* attempts to determine comprehension difficulty of the text 

* originally (1948) used 763 words that were considered simple (80% of fourth-grade students were familiar with those words), <br>
  in 1995 extended to 3,000 words 

* list of 3,000 familiar words:

# Dale-Chall  Readability Test



the forumla used for calculation:   
$$
0.1579 \left (\frac{\mbox{difficult words}}{\mbox{words}}\times 100 \right) + 0.0496 \left (\frac{\mbox{words}}{\mbox{sentences}} \right)
$$

* adjustment: if the percentage of difficult words is above 5%, then add 3.6365 to the raw score to get the adjusted score, 
    otherwise the adjusted score is equal to the raw score

* score interpretation 


 Score |Notes
--------|------- 
 4.9 or lower| easily understood by an average 4th-grade student or lower
 5.0–5.9| easily understood by an average 5th or 6th-grade student
 6.0–6.9| easily understood by an average 7th or 8th-grade student
 7.0–7.9| easily understood by an average 9th or 10th-grade student
 8.0–8.9| easily understood by an average 11th or 12th-grade student
 9.0–9.9| easily understood by an average 13th to 15th-grade (college) student

# SMOG Readability Formula 

* SMOG is an acronym for Simple Measure of Gobbledygook 

* developed by G. Harry McLaughlin in 1969 

* A 2010 study published in the Journal of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh stated that “SMOG should be the preferred measure of readability when evaluating consumer-oriented healthcare material.” The study found that “The Flesch-Kincaid formula significantly underestimated reading difficulty compared with the gold standard SMOG formula.” 

* approximate algorithm for calculating SMOG:

    * count the words of three or more syllables in three 10-sentence samples (beginning, middle, and end are often used),  
    * calculate/estimate the count's square root (from the nearest perfect square), 
    * add 3

# SMOG Readability Formula 

Complete algorithm: 

* Count a number of sentences (at least 30)
* In those sentences, count the polysyllables (words of 3 or more syllables).
* Calculate 
$$
\mbox{grade} = 1.0430 \sqrt{\mbox{number of polysyllables}\times{30 \over \mbox{number of sentences}} } + 3.1291
$$
    (this formula is valid for number of sentences >= 30)

# how do we evaluate texts?

* what is the information that we need to evaluate texts? 

--

    * number of sentences
    * number of words per sentence
    * number of sullables per word 
    * number of sullables per sentence
    * number of simple/hard words
