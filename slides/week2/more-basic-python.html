# Line endings and separators :

-  the use of `end` and `sep` in `print()` function
    - `end` changes what is printed at the end of the string 
    - `sep` changes what is printed in between different arguments 
    - can be used in the same call to the `print()` function
    - can contain one or more characters in single or double quotes 
    
__example__: what is printed by the following code? 
``` python
print("word1", 'word2', "word3", sep=" *** ", end='\n?\n')
print("abcd", "efgh", "ijkl", sep=' : ', end=" END ")
```
--

```
word1 *** word2 *** word3
?
abcd : efgh : ijkl END 
    ```


---

# Escape sequences:

- escape characters allow us to have strings containing special characters 
(i.e., characters that have normally a different meaning in Python)
    - escape sequence starts with a backslash `\` 
    - '\n' - new line character 
    - '\t' - tab character
    - '\\' - backslash character
    - '\"' - double quote character
    - '\'' - single quote character
    - there are others, but these should be enough for a while 
    
__example__: what is printed by the following code? 


.left-column2[
```python
print('   /\\ ')
print('   ""  ')
print('  /""\\ ')
print('  """" ')
print(' /""""\\ ')
print(' """""" ')
print('   ||  ')
```     
]
.right-column2[
```python
print("   /\\ ")
print("   \"\"  ")
print("  /\"\"\\ ")
print("  \"\"\"\" ")
print(" /\"\"\"\"\\ ")
print(" \"\"\"\"\"\" ")
print("   ||  ")
```

# Type conversion and user input:

- type conversions 
    - to change a piece of data from string to int, or from int to float, ... , we need to use conversion function
    - human heads can do this without extra functions
    - computers need to be told explicitly 
    - `int( x )` - converts a string or a number to an integer 
    - `str ( x )` - converts the argument to a string 
    - `float ( x )` - converts a string or a number to a floating point number 

- the `intpu()` function __ALWAYS__ returns a string 
    - convert the return value to a number if it needs to be used as a number

# Data Types
]

---

# why do we need data types? 

- Python needs to know how to set aside memory in your computer based
on what kind of information you want to store

-  There are three basic types of data that we will be working with during
the first half of the term
    -  strings (character-based data)
    -  numbers
    -  logical Values (True / False)

- For numerical types we further subdivide them into 
    - integers
        -  whole numbers that do not contain a decimal point
        -  abbreviated as `int` in Python
        -  example: 5, -5, 100, 10032
    - floating point numbers (the ones you used to call decimal)
        -  numbers that contain a decimal point
        -  abbreviated as `float` in Python
        -  example: 5.0, -5.0, 100.99, 0.232132234


---
# what is the data type of each of those? 

.left-column2[
- 5      
- 5.5     
- "Hello" 
- "5.5"  
- 2.975   
- 2.0     
]

--

.right-column2[
- int 
- float 
- string
- string !!!
- float
- float 
]

--

Keep in mind that the `input()` function __ALWAYS__ returns a string (even if the user types a number). 

```python
# ask the user for their monthly salary
monthly_salary = input('how much do you make in a month?')

# convert the salary into a float
monthly_salary_float = float(monthly_salary)

# calculate the yearly salary
yearly_salary = monthly_salary_float * 12

# print the result
print ('that means you make', yearly_salary, 'in a year')

```

# doing math

# arithmetic operators: 

with numbers (whole numbers and decimal numbers) the above operators are
used to perform standard mathematical operations:

* `+  ` addition, for example `25 + 10` 

* `-  ` subtraction, for example `25 - 10`  

* `*` multiplication, for example `25 * 10`  

* `/` division, for example `25 / 10` 

* `//` division, for example `25 / 10` 

* `%` remainder/modulo, for example `25 / 10` 

* `**` exponentiation, for example `25 ** 10` 

---

# division 

- Python contains two different division operators

- `/` operator is used to calculate the floating-point result of a division
operation (that's what we do in math) 

- `//` operator is used to calculate the integer result of a division
operation 
    - essentially throwing away the remainder or a fractional part  
    - this operation will always round down
    
- most times you will use the floating point division operator (`/`)

--

__example__

.left-column2[
`10 / 5  = ??`

`10 // 5 = ??`


`10 / 4  = ??`

`10 // 4 = ??`
]

--

.right-column2[
`2.0`,  often written as just 2

`2`

`2.25`

`2`

]

---

# remainder / modulo operator 

- the remainder or modulo operator ("%") returns the remainder portion of a division operation

__example__

` 7 / 2 = 3.5 `

` 7 // 2  = 3 `  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there are exactly three 2s that "fit" into a 7 

` 7 % 2 = 1 `   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 is what is left over after we keep removing 2 from 7 as many times as we can 

--

__exercise__  figure out the results of the following expressions 

`11 % 3`

`15 % 4`

`15 % 10`

`20 % 7`

`13 % 13`

`5 % 1`

# errors, bugs and debugging 
]

# why the name?   

__bugs__ are problems or errors in the code 

- the first program/computer bug was an actual bug (a moth, to be exact)

- 1947, Harvard Mark II Computer

# types of errors

- __Syntax errors__: The code does not follow the rules of the language; for
example, a single quote is used where a double quote is needed; a colon is
missing; a keyword is used as a variable name.

- __Runtime errors__: In this case, your code is fine but the program does not run
as expected (it "crashes"). For example, if your program is meant to divide two
numbers, but does not test for a zero divisor, a run-time error would occur
when the program attempts to divide by zero.

- __Logic errors__: These can be the hardest to find. In this case, the program is
correct from a syntax perspective; and it runs; but the result is unanticipated
or outright wrong. For example, if your program prints "2+2 = 5" the answer is
clearly wrong â˜º

# syntax errors 

the IDE or a compiler is good in catching those - but you are the one who needs to fix them

__example__: figure out what is wrong with the following lines of code 

```python

print ( "Hello, world!' )

```
```python

name = input ('Please enter your name: ) 

```
```python

print (" The integer part of 35.01425 is ", int(35.01425 )

```

# syntax errors 

the IDE or a compiler is good in catching those - but you are the one who needs to fix them

__example__: figure out what is wrong with the following lines of code 

```python
# the string delimiters are not matching
print ( "Hello, world!' )   

```
```python
# the closing quote for string is missing 
name = input ('Please enter your name: )  

```
```python
# there are two open parenthesis, but only one closing 
print (" The integer part of 35.01425 is ", int(35.01425 ) 

```

HINT: the context highlighting sometimes gives a clue about syntax problems. 

---
# runtime errors 

these problems happen when the program is running and it is pretty clear that something went wrong - the programmer
has to figure out the reason and fix it 

__example__: figure out what is wrong with the following lines of code; the runtime errors that 
this code causes are shown below


```python
num = input ('give me a number: ') 
new_num = 10 + num
print (new_num)
```
_execution_:

```
give me a number: 15
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
/home/asia/Data/NYU_Teaching/core109/code/week3.py in <module>()
      1 num = input ('give me a number: ')
----> 2 new_num = 10 + num
      3 print (new_num)
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str' 
```

---
# logical errors 

these problems are the hardest to locate: the program runs just fine, but the results are not
what they should be - the programmer needs to be able to recognize the invalid results, find their 
cause and fix the code 


__example__: figure out what is wrong with the following lines of code; the runtime errors that 
this code causes are shown below


```python
num = input ('give me a number: ') 
new_num = 5*num
print ( 5, " * ", num, " = ", new_num)
```
_execution_:

```
give me a number: 13
5  *  13  =  1313131313

```

# simple debugging techniques

- set small, incremental goals for your program; don't try and write large programs all
at once 

- stop and test your work often as you go;  celebrate small successes 
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/81/Noto_Emoji_Oreo_1f389.svg" width=50px alt="celebrate" > 

- use comments to have Python ignore certain lines that are giving you trouble

# code mangler

The __code mangler__ is a mean little creature that sneaks into my computer and _mangles_ the lines 
of code in my programs. 
- sometimes it rearranges the order of the lines
- sometimes it removes all the comments 
- sometimes it removes parts of the lines and replaces the characters by strings of XXXX 
- ...

Can you help me fix this code that the __code mangler__ mangled? 
All the lines and comments are there, but they are in a wrong order. 

```python
# calculate the yearly salary
# print the result
monthly_salary = input('how much do you make in a month?')
print ('that means you make', yearly_salary, 'in a year')
# convert the salary into a float
# ask the user for their monthly salary
monthly_salary_float = float(monthly_salary)
yearly_salary = monthly_salary_float * 12
```

__Solution__
Try to run your fixed code and see if it is working.
