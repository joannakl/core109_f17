# let's start with an example 

```python

name = input("Hello! What is your name? ")

num_of_languages = input("How many programming languages do you know? ")

num_of_languages = int( num_of_languages )

if  num_of_languages == 0 :
    print (name + ", you are about to learn your first programming language!")
else:
    print (name + ", I think you are in a wrong class! Talk to Joanna about this.")


```

- Do think that all of the lines of code  are executed by the computer
when we run the program? Explain your answer.

--

- Notice that the `print` instructions after the `if ...` and `else ...` lines
are indented. What happens when you try to remove the indent?

```python
if some_condition_to_check : 
    code to execute
    when the condition turns out
    to be true

continue_with_the_rest_of_the_code 
```
]

- the `if` statement allows us to tell Python to execute the code only is some condition turns out to be true

- __example__

    ``` python
    today = input("what day is today" )
    
    if today == "Thursday":
        print("Go to the lab at Tisch, room LC19")
    
    print("Have a nice day!")
    
    ```

# this or that 
.box[
```python
if some_condition_to_check : 
    code to execute when the condition 
    turns out to be true
else:
    code to execute when the condition
    turns out to be false 
    
continue_with_the_rest_of_the_code 
```
]

- the `if ... else ...` statement allows us to tell Python to execute one block of code if some condition turns out to be true and a different one
if that condition turns out to be false 

- __example__

    ``` python
    today = input("what day is today" )
    
    if today == "Thursday":
        print("Go to the lab at Tisch, room LC19")
    else:
        print("Go to the lecture at 7 East 12th Street, room 125") 
    
    print("Have a nice day!")
    
    ```

---
# this or that or that ... or ...
.box[
```python
if condition_1_to_check : 
    code to execute when the condition_1 is true 
elif condition_2_to_check :
    code to execute when the condition_2 is true 
elif ...
    ...
else:
    code to execute when all of the conditions turn out to be false 
    
continue_with_the_rest_of_the_code 
```
]

- the `if ... elif ... else ...` statement allows us to tell Python to execute a different block of code depending of a collection of different conditions.

# this or that or that ... or ...
.box[
```python
if condition_1_to_check : 
    code to execute when the condition_1 is true 
elif condition_2_to_check :
    code to execute when the condition_2 is true 
elif ...
    ...
else:
    code to execute when all of the conditions turn out to be false

    elif today == "Monday" or today == "Wednesday" :
        print("Go to the lecture at 7 East 12th Street, room 125") 
    else:
        print("We do not have a class today")
    print("Have a nice day!")

# Boolean expresssions 
## (or what can be used as a condition)  
]

# Boolean values 

- Boolean values can be either true or false - yes, there are only two 
possible values

- __in Python, these values are represented by the reserved words, `True`
 and `False` (notice that the initial letter is uppercase)__
 
- comparisons evaluate to Boolean values
    - `10 < 15` evaluates to `True`
    - `"Asia" > "Europe"` evaluates to  `False`
    - `(12 + 3) == 15` evaluates to `True` 
 
---

# `=` vs. `==`

- `=` (equals) is the __assignment operator__
    - assigns the value of the thing on the right to the variable on the left
    - sometimes called binding
    - example: `a = "foo"` gives value of string `"foo"` to the variable
    `a` 
    

- `==` (double equals) is the __comparison equality operator__
    - tests if the thing on the left is equal to the thing on the right
    - also called logical equivalence
    - example: `"foo" == "bar"` evaluates to `False`  

--

Warning: Python is case sensitive and it does not like to mix numbers and strings. 

__exercise__ Try to figure out the value of the following comparisons.

.left-column2[
`'One' == 'one'`

`'1.0' == 1.0`

`'one' == 1`

`1 == 1.0`

`"one" == 'one'`

]
--
.right-column2[
`False`

`False`

`False`

`True`

`True`

]

# dozens of doughnuts <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Noto_Emoji_Oreo_1f369.svg"  width=70px>  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Emojione_1F369.svg"width=70px>

What is the output of this program when the user enters different values in response to the prompt?

```python
answer = input("you have 12 doughnuts, would you like another dozen? \n")

if answer == 'yes':
	print('you have 24 doughnuts')
else:
	print('you have 12 doughnuts')
```

_program user exchange:_

```
you have 12 doughnuts, would you like another dozen? 
*yes
```
--
```
you have 24 doughnuts
```
--
----- 
```
you have 12 doughnuts, would you like another dozen?

# math quiz: exponents

What is the output of this program when the user enters the correct answer? 

```python
answer = input('what is 2 to the 4th power?\n')

if answer == 2 ** 4:
	print('yup, you got it!')
else:
	print('sorry, you got that wrong')
```

--

- this program has a logical error:

- it always compares a string (containing the correct or incorrect
answer) to a number 

- the Boolean expression (`answer == 2 ** 4`) __always__ evaluates
to `False`

- the output of this program is always: 

    `   sorry, you got that wrong`

# comparison operators

- there are six comparison operators:<br>

    - `==`  equals (can be called logical equivalence or equality operator)
    
    - `!=`  not equal
    
    - `>`  greater than
    
    - `<`  less than
    
    - `>=` greater than / equal
    
    - `<=`  less than / equal

- those operators always return a Boolean value: `True` or `False`

- they work with numbers, 

- they also work with strings,

---
# comparison examples 

- `5.5 < 13` returns `True`

- `78 != n` returns either `True` or `False` depending on the value of `n` 
(assuming `n` has a value)


- `"apple" < "pear"` returns `True` - the order is based on the
alphabetical ordering of characters,
    - well, not really
    - it actually uses [ASCII](http://www.asciitable.com/) ordering 
    
- `"Apple" == "apple"` returns `False` - the upper case letters
come _before_ the lower case letters in ASCII 

---

# logical operators 

- `and` - takes two operands, one on each side
to return `True`, both sides of the operator must be `True`

- `or`  - takes two operands, one on each side
to return `True`, at least one side of the operator must be `True` 

- `not` - only takes one operand to the right
to return `True`, the original value on the right must evaluate to `False` 
two nots cancel eachother out (fun!) 

---

# truth tables

- the truth table tells us the value of the logical expression
given all different posibilities of the operands



```
 p | q | p and q
----------------
 f | f |   f
 f | t |   f
 t | f |   f
 t | t |   t
```
---  

```
 p | q | p and q
----------------
 f | f |   f
 f | t |   t
 t | f |   t
 t | t |   t
```
---  

```
 p | not p
-----------
 t |  f 
 f |  t 
```

# Positive, negative or zero

- Write a program that prompts the user for a number.

- The program should then determine if the number entered
is positive negative or zero.

- The program should them print appropriate message, for example <br>
    `Your number is negative`

--- 

- Change your above program so instead of numbers it works with 
temperatures. 

    - if the value entered is below freezing, the program should 
    print <br>
        `it is below freezing`
    - if the value entered is above freezing, the program should 
    print <br>
        `it is still warm`
    - if the value entered is exactly at 32 degrees, the program
    should print  <br>
        `it is just border-line, hope it is going up!`

# Calculating bonuses

.left-column2[
- You're the manager of a large, distributed sales force
- You want to create an easy to use tool that will allow your sales staff to do
the following:
    - Input their monthly sales amount
    - Determine if they made their monthly quota of $10,000
    - If they made their quota, they are eligible for a bonus of 50% of whatever
    they sold above the $10,000
    - If they made their quota, they should receive a "Good Job!" message
    - At the end of the program you should print out how much their bonus will be.
