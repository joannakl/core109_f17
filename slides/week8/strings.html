# what are strings in Python? 

* A String is a data type in the Python programming language

* A String can be described as a _sequence of characters_

* Characters are arranged in a particular position in a String.
    For example:
    
    ```python
    word1 ="hello"
    ```

* In this String the character 'h' is the first character in the
String, followed by 'e', etc. The following String contains the
same characters but they are at different positions:
    
    ```python
    word2 ="loleh"
    ```

# accessing characters in a string 

* iterating over strings with a `for` loop

    ```python
    for c in "Core 109":
        print (c, sep = '~')
    ```
    
    produces output of 
    
    ```
    C~o~r~e~ ~1~0~9
    ```
--
    
* using indexes to access individual characters 

    ```python
    word = "Shakespeare"
    print (word[0])       //prints S
    print (word[4])       //prints e
    print (word[9])       //prints r   
    ``` 
    accessing index out of range of valid indexes, produces an error in Python 

    !!! we cannot change characters in a string !!! 

    ```python
    word[0] = 's'  //does not work !!! 
    ```

---

# length of strings

__`len()`__ function can be used to determine the length of a string 

```python
word = "superman"
num_of_characters = len(word)
print ( num_of_characters ) 
``` 

output 

```
8
``` 

---

# what will this program do? 

```python
phrase = 'Superman sings in the shower'
counter = 0
for c in phrase :
    if c == 's' or c =='S':
        counter += 1
print ( counter )
```
--

output

```
4
```

* how would you rewrite it to count all the occurences of letter 'o'?

* how would you rewrite it to count all the occurences of vowels? 

* write a program that prints a string in reverse

* write a program that prints every other character in a string

# slicing strings
]

---

# string slices 

* sometimes we want  to extract a portion of a string from another string

* we use __slicing__ to extract substrings from a string 

    ```python
    full_name ="John Smith"
    first_name = full_name[0:4]
    print (first_name)
    ```

    output: 
    
    ```
    John
    ``` 

---

# string slices 

* we use __bracket notation__ to specify the index range of the characters we want to extract

* the syntax for this notation is as follows:
    
    ```
    substring = bigstring[ start:end:step ]
    ``` 
    
    * we must supply at least a `start` or an `end` index value, 
    * the other values are optional
    
* extracted substring contains all characters starting at the `start` index and
continue up to (but do not include) the `end` index

* omitting a `start` index will cause Python to assume
you want to start at the beginning of the string 

* omitting a `end` index will cause Python to assume
    you want to continue till the end of the string 

* (specifying the range of characters to extract looks very much like 
the `range()` function)

# string slices - example 

What will the following code print?

```python

word = "Superman sings in the shower."

print(word[0:8])

print(word[9:14])

print(word[:5])

print(word[9:])

print(word[0:len(word):3])

```


---

# string slices - example 

What will the following code print?

```python


word = "Superman sings in the shower."

print(word[0:8])        # Supermen

print(word[9:14])       # sings

print(word[:5])         # Super

print(word[9:])         # sings in the shower.

print(word[0:len(word):3])  # Seasgit or 

```

# more operations on strings 
]

---
# concatenation with __`+`__ and __`*`__ 

* We already know that the "+" and "*" operators can be used
in conjunction with a String

* The "+" operator can be used to "concatenate" two Strings
together

* The "*" operator can be used to repeat a String a certain
number of times (specified as an integer)



---
# testing if characters or substrings are in a string

* The __`in`__ operator is a Boolean operator that you can use to
test to see if a substring exists inside of another string.

    ```python
    phrase = "Jackson James John Chris Tom"
    if "Chris" in phrase:
        print ("found him!")
    else:
        print ("can't find Chris")
    ```

* We can also test to see if a string is not in another string by
using the __`not in`__ keyword in an expression.

    ```python 
    phrase = "Jackson James John Chris Tom"
    if "Johnny" not in phrase:
        print ("No Johnny!")
    else:
        print ("Johnny is here!")
    ```

---
# string testing functions 

Here are some useful functions that are called on strings (using the 
__dot operator__):

* __`isalnum()`__ `True` if all characters are alphanumeric

* __`isalpha()`__ `True` if all characters are alphabetic

* __`isdigit()`__ `True` if all characters are digits

* __`islower()`__ `True` is all alpha characters are lower

* __`isspace()`__ `True` if all characters are "whitespace"

* __`isupper()`__ `True` if all alpha characters are upper


---
# string modification functions 

These are also functions called on strings. They return the modified version!
They do not change the string on which they are called:

* __`lower()`__ 
 returns a lowercase version of the string
 
* __`upper()`__
 returns an uppercase version of the string
 
* __`rstrip()`__
 removes whitespace at end of string
 
* __`lstrip()`__
removes leading whitespace characters

* __`capitalize()`__
returns a copy of the string with the first
character capitalized

* __`title()`__
returns a copy of the string with the first
character of each word capitalized

* __`swapcase()`__ 
returns a copy of the string where case is
swapped among all alpha characters 



---
# searching and replacing

* You can find whether a string exists inside another string by
using the __`find()`__ function. 
    
    ```python
    phrase = "Like finding a needle in a haystack!"
    location = phrase.find("needle")
    print (location)
    ``` 
    
* The `find()` function returns the index of the first
occurrence of a substring within a string.

* If the `find()` method cannot find the desired substring it
will return -1

--

* You can have Python replace all occurrences of a substring
by using the __`replace( )`__ method.

* __`replace( str1, str2 )`__ function replaces every
occurrence of `str1` with `str2`

    ```python
    phrase = "Voldemort had one goal in life - to kill Harry Potter."
    newphrase = word.replace("Voldemort", "He who shall not be named")
    printprint(phrase)
    print (newphrase)
    ```

# password validator

* Write a program that asks the user to enter a username and select a password
for it. 

* The program the should _validate_ the password using the following rules
    
    * the password cannot contain the username as its substring
    
    * the password cannot contain the string `password` as its substring
    
    * the password has to contain at least one digit
    
    * the password has to contain at least one upper case and one lower case character
    
* If the password is valid, the program should print "OK". If it is not,
the program should print "Invalid!" 
---

# character analysis

* Write a program that counts the number of spaces, digits, vowels
and consonants in a string that the user inputs. 

example output: 

```
Enter a phrase: Sally Sells 1000 sea shells.

 Spaces: 4
 Digits: 4
 Vowels: 5
 Consonants: 12
```

# Pig Latin translator 


* Write a program that asks the
user for a word

* Translate their word into Pig
Latin. A Pig Latin word can be
generated using the following
rules:

    * Remove the first letter of the word

    * Place the first letter of the word at the end of the word

    * Add the string "ay" to the end of the word

---
# Palindome tester

* Write a program that asks the user for a word

* Determine whether the supplied word is a palindrome (a word that 
reads the same backwards and forwards)


---
# Vowel Counter 

* Write a program that counts the #'s of vowels in a
string (A,E,I,O,U,Y)

* Display the results for each vowel

* Extra challenge: how would you display the results so that they are
more _visual_ than just numbers.
