<strong>Programming Problems</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Write a program that prints out all even numbers between 1 and 100,000.</li>
<li>Write a program that continually asks the user for a series of prices. Keep track of the running total as the user enters prices. Prompt the user after each price to see if they wish to continue entering prices. When they are finished, print out the total amount entered.</li>
<li>Write a program that asks the user for a number of days. Then prompt the user for their weight on each day they specified (i.e. if they enter 7 you should ask them for 7 weight values). When they are finished print out their average weight for the period in question. Sample running:
<pre>Enter a number of days: 3
Day 1: Enter a weight: 180
Day 2: Enter a weight: 175
Day 3: Enter a weight: 170

Average weight for 3 days: 175.0</pre>
<p>————</li>

<li>Re-write the previous program so that you re-prompt them if the user enters an invalid weight y(anything 0 or less). Ensure that you don't move to the next day without getting a valid weight. Sample running:
<pre>Enter a number of days: 3
Day 1: Enter a weight: 180
Day 2: Enter a weight: 0
Invalid, try again!
Day 2: Enter a weight: -5
Invalid, try again!
Day 2: Enter a weight: 175
Day 3: Enter a weight: 170

Average weight for 3 days: 175.0</pre>
<p>————</li>


<li>Write a function that accepts two arguments and computes the first argument raised to the power of the second argument. For example:
<pre>myfun(5,2)

&gt;&gt; 25</pre>
<p>————</li>
<li>You are working for a fireworks company that wants to try out a new marketing strategy. They would like to try a new promotion that gives away free fireworks to customers who purchase a certain quantity – the more you buy, the more free fireworks you get! Here is their current promotion:
<pre>Buy between 1 and 10 fireworks, get 0 free
Buy between 11 and 20 fireworks, get 1 free
Buy between 21 and 30 fireworks, get 3 free
Buy more than 31 fireworks, get 5 free</pre>
<p>————<br />
Write a function that accepts one argument (# of fireworks) and returns the number of free fireworks that should be given away with that order.</li>
<li>Write a program that prompts the user for an amount of fireworks. Then use your fireworks function that you wrote for the previous problem to figure out how many free fireworks they are eligible for. Print out a summary like the following and allow the user to continue entering quantities if desired.
<pre>Enter a quantity:  100
You are eligible for 5 free fireworks!
Would you like to calculate another quantity? (yes/no): yes
Enter a quantity:  3
Sorry, you are not eligible for any free fireworks.
Would you like to calculate another quantity? (yes/no): no</pre>
<p>————</li>
<li>Write a function that accepts a grade as a single floating point value and returns its letter equivalent. Letters grades can be determined using the following table:
<pre>100-90: A
80-89.99: B
70-79.99: C
65-69.99: D
Lower than 65: F</pre>
<p>————</li>
<li>Write a program that continually asks the user for a grade value. Use the function you wrote for question #8 to determine the equivalent letter grade. You can assume the user is finished entering grades when they enter in an invalid number (i.e. one greater than 100 or less than 0). Here is a sample running of this program:
<pre>Enter a grade:  98
98 is a(n) A
Enter a grade:  76
76 is a(n) C
Enter a grade:  -2</pre>
<p>————</li>
<li>A Pokemon training facility has recently hired you to write an e-commerce application that will allow members of the general public to purchase Pokemon online. Currently only three types of Pokemon will be available through this online store – the cost of each type is as follows:
<pre>Pokemon		Cost Per Pokemon
Pikachu		$10.00
Charmander	$15.00
Squirtle	$20.00</pre>
<p>Write a function to that accepts two arguments: the type of Pokemon the user wishes to purchase (as a String) and the number of Pokemon (as an integer). Your function should calculate the total cost of this order and return it to the user (as a float).</p>
<p>Note that if the function is called with an invalid Pokemon name (i.e. “Bulbasaur”) the function should return the value -1 to the caller. The function should, however, handle uppercase and lowercase versions of the same Pokemon (i.e. both “PIKACHU” and “pikachu” are valid names). You do not need to account for negative quantities in your function (this will be taken care of in the next problem) and you can always assume that the function will be called with an integer value representing the desired quantity.  You only need to write the function outlined above. You will use this function to write a complete program in the next question. Be sure to comment your function using IPO notation.</li>
<li>Write a program that continually prompts the user for two values – the name of a Pokemon and the desired quantity they wish to purchase. The user can only enter values greater than zero – anything else should cause the program to print an error and re-prompt the user. You can assume that the user will enter an integer during the input phase of your program.
<p>Next, utilize the function you wrote for the previous question and generate output like the following. Note that you do not need to re-write your function here – you can simply call it as though it was already defined in this program. You should prompt your user at the end of your program to see if they would like to purchase additional Pokemon and, if so, you should run your program again.</p>
<pre>What kind of Pokemon would you like to buy?  Pikachu
How many would you like to purchase?  2

2 Pikachu will cost $20.00

Would you like to purchase more Pokemon? (yes/no):  yes

What kind of Pokemon would you like to buy?  Bulbasaur
How many would you like to purchase?  0
That’s not a valid number, try again
How many would you like to purchase?  1

Sorry, that Pokemon is not currently available.

Would you like to purchase more Pokemon? (yes/no):   no</pre>
</li>
<li>Write a function that accepts a single string as an argument. Your function should then determine if the string contains a majority of uppercase characters. For example, the String "ABCab" has 3 uppercase characters out of its 5 total characters, so it contains a majority of uppercase characters. If so, return True, and if not return False.</li>
<li>Write a function that accepts a single string as an argument. Flip the case of the String so that uppercase characters become lowercase and lowercase characters become uppercase.  Return the new string.</li>

<li>Write a FUNCTION called “valid_n_number” that determines if a NYU Student ID is valid. For the purpose of this question a valid NYU Student ID is defined as follows:
exactly 9 characters long
begins with the uppercase character ‘N’
all characters beside the beginning ‘N’ character must be numbers
Your function should accept a test “N number” as an ARGUMENT (String) and RETURN a status value (Boolean). Here’s a sample program that uses your function:

<pre>
test1 = valid_n_number("N123")
test2 = valid_n_number("N1234567890")
test3 = valid_n_number("P12345678")
test4 = valid_n_number("NXYZ!5678")
test5 = valid_n_number("N12345678")

print (test1, test2, test3, test4, test5) </pre>
And here’s the expected output:
<pre>
False False False False True</pre></li>
