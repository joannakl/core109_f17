<p><strong>Write a Program (solutions below)</strong></p>

<p>Use your programming skills to solve the following programming challenges:</p>

<ol>
<li>Write a program that asks the user to supply two words. Sort the words in alphabetical order and print them back to the user.</li>
<li>Write a program that qualfies the user for a particular credit card. Users must meet the following criteria:
<ul>
<li>Make at least 30,000 per yeay</li>
<li>Their rent payment must not be more than 5% of their total salary per month (i.e. 1,500 is the max rent that they can pay while making 30,000 per year)</li>
<li>However, if they own their home you do not need to take their monthly house payment into account</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a sample running of the program:</p>
<pre>Credit card qualifier
How much do you make per year? 30000
Do you own your home? (y/n) y
You qualify!



Credit card qualifier
How much do you make per year? 35000
Do you own your home? (y/n) n
How much do you pay in rent per month? 1000
You qualify!



Credit card qualifier
How much do you make per year? 50000
Do you own your home? (y/n) n
How much do you pay in rent per month? 5000
Sorry, you don't qualify. Your rent is too high</pre>
</li>
<li>Write a program to ask a user to enter in 3 test scores (0-100) and 1 homework score (0-100). Then calculate the user’s grade using the following formula – Tests: 50% Homework: 50%. You can assume the user will enter integer values.  Print out the grade as a number (i.e. 78.56%) along with its letter equivalent (i.e. ‘C’). For the purposes of this program you can assume that A = 90-100, B = 80-89.99, C = 70-79.99, D = 65-69.99 and F is less than 65</li>
<li>A company has determined that its annual profit is typically 23 percent of total sales. Write a program that asks the user to enter in the projected amount of total sales and then displays the profit that will be made from that amount.</li>
<li>One acre of land is equivalent to 43,560 square feet. Write a program that asks the user to enter the total square feet in a tract of land and calculate the number of acres in that tract.</li>
<li>A customer in a store is purchasing 5 items. Write a program that asks for the price of each item, and then displays the subtotal of the sale, the amount of sales tax, and the total. Assume the sales tax is 6 percent.</li>
<li>Write a program to input a 2 digit integer, call it x, where the rightmost digit is nonzero. Compute the integer y which has the same digits as x, but in reverse order. Print out x, y and x+y. For example:
  <pre>Please enter a two digit integer: 23 
23 reversed is: 32 
23 + 32 is 55</pre>
</li>


  <li>Analyze the code below and identify any problems or issues that might exist.  Offer suggestions on how to re-engineer the code to prevent these errors from occurring and/or rewrite the code so that it functions correctly.
<pre>rate = str(input("How much do you make per hour? ‘))
hours = input("How many hours did you work this week? ")

if hours < 40:
	pay = rate * hours
if hours > 40
	pay = rate * 40
	ot_pay = (hours-40) ** (rate*1.5)

print ("Your total pay is, pay + ot_pay")</pre>
</li>

<li>Write a "calculator" program that asks the user for two numbers as well as an "operation code" ("a" for add, "s" for subtract, "d" for divide or "m" for multiply).  Using the information provided perform the specified operation and print the result.  Here is a sample running of the program:

<pre>Number 1: 2.0
Number 2: 3.0
Operation (a/s/d/m): a

2.0 + 3.0 = 5.0  </pre>

Note that you cannot assume that the user will enter a valid operation code (i.e. they could type in the string "multiply" instead of the string "m").  In this case you will need to present the user with some kind of error (i.e. "Sorry, that’s not a valid operation code") and re-prompt them. However, you can assume that the user will input valid floating-point numbers when prompted.

Also note that dividing a number by 0 will result in a runtime error.  Prevent this from happening in your program by providing special output in this case 
(i.e. 5.0 / 0.0 = undefined)</li>

<li>A small college has asked you to write a program for their admissions department to help them determine if a student should be accepted into their school.  Write a program that uses the following criteria to determine whether a given applicant should be admitted:

<ul>
	<li>Combined SAT score of 1600 or more</li>
	<li>A high school GPA of 3.0 or higher</li>
	<li>At least 3 extracurricular activities</li>
</ul>

However, this particular school places a heavy emphasis on extracurricular activities, so students with 5 or more activities only need a 1400 combined score on their SAT and a GPA of 2.8.  Comment your code as necessary. You can assume that the user will enter floating-point values.  

Here are three sample runnings of your program.  

<pre>Student name: Craig
Combined SAT Score: 1800
High school GPA: 3.2
# of extracurricular activities: 3
Craig should be admitted!


Student name: John
Combined SAT Score: 1500
High school GPA: 3.1
# of extracurricular activities: 7
John should be admitted!


Student name: Chris
Combined SAT Score: 1300
High school GPA: 2.9
# of extracurricular activities: 8
Chris should not be admitted.

</li>

<li>Write a program that prints out all even numbers between 1 and 100,000.</li>

<li>Write a program that asks the user for a number of days. Then prompt the user for their weight on each day they specified (i.e. if they enter 7 you should ask them for 7 weight values). When they are finished print out their average weight for the period in question. Sample running:
<pre>Enter a number of days: 3
Day 1: Enter a weight: 180
Day 2: Enter a weight: 175
Day 3: Enter a weight: 170

Average weight for 3 days: 175.0</pre>
</pre>


</ol>

<br><br> 

<p><strong>Code Mangler Problems (solutions below)</strong></p>

<p>Code mangler mixed up the lines of several programs. Try to unscramble the lines 
to create working programs. </p>

<ol>

<li>The following program should calculate the weekly pay including the 
overtime for hours worked over 40 hrs/week calculated at 1.5 times the regulare pay rate.

The lines of the program have been sorted in alphabetical order and all of the indentation is gone. 

<pre>
else:
hours = float(input("How many hours did you work this week? "))
if hours < 40:
ot_pay = (hours-40) * (rate*1.5)
pay = rate * 40 + ot_pay
pay = rate * hours
print ("Your total pay is", pay)
rate = float(input("How much do you make per hour? "))
</pre>

</li>

<li>The following program used to print a temperatur conversion table. Can you fix it so it 
does this again?
<pre>
f = 9/5*c+32
for c in range(-10, 41, 2):
print("-------------------")
print("Celsius\tFahrenheit")
print (c, f, sep="\t")   
</pre>
</li>

<li>This program should calculate the sume of all the numbers between the two
values specified by the user. But the code mangler removed some parts of the program and 
replaced them with   &#9786;  &#9786;  &#9786;.
Can you complete the program so that it worksagain?</li>
<pre>
total =  &#9786;  &#9786;  &#9786;
start = int(input("Enter starting number"))
end = int(input("Enter ending number"))
for i in  &#9786;  &#9786;  &#9786; :      
    total +=  &#9786;  &#9786;  &#9786;
print("Sum from", start, "to", end, "inclusively:", total)
</pre>


<li>
Here is  a program that asks a teacher for the number of students in his or her class. 
Next, the program asks the teacher how many assignments are given in the class. 
With this information the program prompts the user to enter in scores for each student 
and computes their average grade in the class. 

Code mangler removed all the indentation and sorted the lines. Can you fix it?

<pre>
# add to this student's points
# ask the teacher for assignments
# ask the teacher for # students
# assume the student earned no points
for assignment in range(0,numassignments):
for student in range(0,numstudents):
# get points earned for this assignment
# go through each assignment
# go through each student
# loop is over - compute student's score
numassignments = int(input('assignments: '))
numstudents = int(input('students: '))
print ("Student #", student)
print ("This student earned:", studentpoints/numassignments)
score = float(input('Assignment: '))
studentpoints = 0
studentpoints += score
</pre></li>

<li>
Here is a program that calculates ones salary at the end of year 1 through year 10
given the user specified initial salary and the user specified percent increase at the end
of each year.  

This time, the code mangler removed all of the code. The only thing left are the comments.
Can you recreate the program? 

Oh, and here is a sample run of the program before the code mangler got to it: 

<pre>
---
Enter your initial salary: 50000

Enter the percent increase at the end of each year [2, for 2%, for example]: 2

year    salary
1       $51000.00
2       $52020.00
3       $53060.40
4       $54121.61
5       $55204.04
6       $56308.12
7       $57434.28
8       $58582.97
9       $59754.63
10      $60949.72
---
</pre>


<pre>

#set the number of years to 10


#get the salary from the user


#get the percentage increase for the user 


#print the header for the table 


#iterate 10 times to print the salaries at the end of each year 

    #calculate the new salary 

    #print the year and the salary 

</pre></li>

<p><strong>Short Answers</strong></p>

<p><em>Explain what a Boolean expression is and why you would use one while programming. Give three examples.</em></p>
<p>A Boolean expression is an expression that compares two or more values.  It almost always involves the use a relational operator (>, <, ==, !=, etc) and always evaluates to True or False.  We use Boolean expressions in Python to ask a question (i.e. if number < 0 then print "no negative numbers allowed!"), to control a repetition structure (i.e. while keepgoing == True, perform some operation) and to store a logical value in a variable (i.e. answer = 5 > 2)</p>

<p><em>Identify three functions that convert data from one data type to another. Provide a practical example of each function and describe when you would use it in an actual program.</em></p>
<p>The float(), int() and str() functions convert data from one data type to another.  Here are a few examples:

<pre># turn the user's input into a floating point number
answer = float(input("Enter a number: "))

# turn a String into an integer
a = "525"
b = int(a)

# convert a number into a String
a = 525
b = str(a)</pre>

<p><em>Name and describe three different data types in Python and when they could be used in a program</em></p>
<p>Integer: used to store whole number values.  Useful for creating "counter" accumulator variables.  Float: used to store floating point numbers.  Useful for storing currency values.  String: used to store sequences of characters, such as "Hello, World!"</p>
