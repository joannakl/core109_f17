1a. total(years) = 1,000 + 50 * years

1b. total(years) = 1,000 * (1.045)^years

2. 0.002 * 2^n  where ^ denotes the exponent 

3a.
Sample answer: 

initial bill = 100

end of month 1, payment = 20.00 
	remaining balance: 100 - 20 = 80

end of  month 2 payment = 20.00 
	balance from previous month plus interest: 80 * 1.014 =  81.12Â 
	remaining balance: 81.12 - 20 = 61.12

end of  month 3 payment =  20.00 
	balance from previous month plus interest: 61.12 * 1.014 = 61.97568
	remaining balance: 61.97568 - 20 = 41.97568

end of  month 4 payment = 20.00 
	balance from previous month plus interest: 41.97568 * 1.014 = 42.56333952
	remaining balance: 42.56333952 - 20 = 22.56333952

end of  month 5 payment = 20.00 
	balance from previous month plus interest: 22.56333952 * 1.014 = 22.87922627
	remaining balance: 22.87922627 - 20 = 2.87922627

end of  month 6 payment = 2.92
	balance from previous month plus interest: 2.87922627 * 1.014 = 2.919535441
	remaining balance: 0.00 

Answer = 6 months


The algorithm:

Bill = 100.00
month_1 = (100 - 20) * 1.014			
month_2 = (month_1 -20) * 1.014
month_3 = (month_2 -20) * 1.014
...


3b.

The algorithm:

Bill = 100.00
month_1 = (100 - 40) * 1.014			
month_2 = (month_1 -40) * 1.014
...


Sample answer: 

initial bill = 100

end of month 1, payment = 40  
	remaining balance: 100 - 40 = 60

end of  month 2 payment = 40
	balance from previous month plus interest: 60 * 1.014 =  60.84
	remaining balance: 60.84 - 40 = 20.84

end of  month 3 payment = 21.13 
	balance from previous month plus interest: 20.84 * 1.014 = 21.13176
	remaining balance: 0.00

Answer = 3 months
