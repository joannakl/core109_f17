# game rules

1. Organise yourselves into pairs. One of you has sheet 
2A, the other sheet 2B. __Don’t show your sheet to your partner!__

2. Both of you circle one battleship on the top part of your game sheet and tell your partner its number (the numbers are in the range from 1 to 10,000 - the battle ships
are organized from the smallest number to the largest number).

3. Now take turns to guess where your partner’s ship is. __You say the letter name of a ship and your partner tells you the number of the ship at that letter.__

4. Keep track of how many shots it took for each of you to locate your partner’s ship? This is your score for the game.

You can play again, if you wish - just ask Joanna for different game sheets.

# follow up discussion

- What were the scores?

--

- What strategy did the high scorers use?

--

- What strategy did the low scorers use?

--

- Which ship should you choose first? 

--

    - The one in the middle tells you which half of the line the chosen ship must be in. 
    
- Which location would you choose next? 

--

    - Again the best strategy is always to choose the middle ship of the 
    section that must have the selected ship.)

--

- If this strategy is applied how many shots will it take to find a ship? 

    - Five at most.
    
    - This method is called ‘binary search’, because it divides the problem into two parts.

# writing the program

- Write a program that implements the guesser.
