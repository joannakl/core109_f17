# variables vs. lists

* So far we have been working with variables, which can be
thought of as _buckets_ that hold a particular piece of data

* Variables can only hold one piece of data at a time. Example
    * `x = 5`
    * `y = 5.0`
    * `z = 'hello'`
    * `q = True`
    
* However, there are times when we need to keep track of
multiple pieces of data at the same time, and a single
variable is limited to holding just one thing at a time

--

* Lists are considered a “sequence” object. Sequence objects
have the ability to hold multiple pieces of data at the same
time.

* We can use a single sequence variable to hold any number
of values.

* In most programming languages we call these _arrays_. In
Python we call these __lists__.

# list creation 

* we can create a list in Python by using the __bracket notation__.

    ```python
    my_list = [1, 2, 3]
    ```
    * to create an empty list, we just use a set of square brackets (we'll see soon why
    one would want an empty list 
    
        ```python
        my_list = []    # creates an empty list 
        ```
    * to create a list with a preset number of elements with the same value
        ```python
        my_list1 = [0] * 10     # creates a list of ten zeros
        ``` 
    * to create a list with a preset number of elements with the same value
        ```python
        my_list1 = [0] * 10     # creates a list of ten zeros 
        my_list2 = ['Amy'] * 5  # creates a list of five strings 'Amy'
        ```
        
    * we can use the `range()` function to create a list as well - we just need to 
    convert the iterable to a list 
        
        ```python
        even_numbers = list(range(0,100,2))
        ```
    
---
# operations on the whole list 

* we can print the value of a list using the print() function.

    ```python
    my_list = [67, 98, 1, 45, 90] 
    print (my_list)
    ```
    
    output:
    ```
    [67, 98, 1, 45, 90] 
    ```
* we can determine the length of the list by using the `len()` function

    ```python
    my_list = [67, 98, 1, 45, 90] 
    print ( len(my_list) )
    ```
    
    output:
    ```
    5
    ```

---
# combining lists

* __list repetition__ - just use the repetition operator `*` 
(similar to repeating strings) 

    example: 

    ```python
    my_list = [1, 2, 3] * 3
    print (my_list)
    ```

    output: 

    ```
    [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
    ```
--

* __list concatenation__ - use he concatenation operator `+` to combine
different lists into a single list 

    example: 

    ```python
    my_list = [1, 2, 3] + [99, 100, 101]
    print (my_list)
    ```

    output: 

    ```
     [1, 2, 3, 99, 100, 101]
    ```

---
# accessing list elements 

* in a book we can reference a page by its page number

* in a list we can reference an element by its __index__ number

* __indexes start at the number zero__

* example:
     
    ```python
    my_list = ['Ann', 'John', 'Kate']
    print (my_list[0])
    print (my_list[2])
    ```

    output:

    ```
    Ann
    Kate
    ``` 

--

* we will get an error if we attempt to access an
element outside the range of a list. 

    ```python
    my_list = ['Craig', 'John', 'Chris']
    print (my_list[4]) # Index doesn't exist!
    ```

---
# modifying list elements 

* we can change elements in the list by assigning a new value to 
the location at a particular index 

* example:
     
    ```python
    my_list = [1, 2, 3]
    print (my_list)
    ```

    output:

    ```
    [1, 2, 3]
    ``` 
     
    ```python
    my_list[1] = 99
    print (my_list)

    ```

    output:

    ```
    [1, 99, 3]
    ``` 

---
# lists can have multiple names 

* when we assign a list name to a new variable, we do not create another list,
the list is simply given another name

* example:

    ```python
    mylist1 = [1, 2, 3 ]
    mylist2 = mylist1           # now we have two different names for the same list 
    
    print (mylist1)
    print (mylist2)
    ``` 
    output:

    ```
    [1, 2, 3]
    [1, 2, 3]
    ``` 

    ```python
    mylist1[0] = 55             # changes the element at index zero in both lists 
    mylist2[1] = 100            # changes the element at index one in both lists
    
    print (mylist1)
    print (mylist2)
    ``` 
    output:

    ```
    [55, 100, 3]
    [55, 100, 3]
    ``` 

---
# creating a copy of a list 

* to create a duplicate of a list (the actual second list, not just a different name for
the same list) we need to use a trick 

    * `[]` in python denotes an empty list
    
    * concatenating an empty list with an existing list creates a new list:
    
    ```python
    mylist = [1, 2, 3 ]
    mylist_copy = [] + mylist     #creates a new list
    
    mylist[2] = 5
    
    print(mylist)
    print(mylist_copy) 
    ``` 
    output:

    ```
    [1, 2, 5]
    [1, 2, 3]
    ```

# using a `for` loop 

* the target variable assumes the value of each element in the list in order

* example 

    ```python
    mylist = [1, 2, 3]

    for num in mylist :
        print (num)
    ```
    output:
    ```
    1
    2
    3
    ```

# write a program: count B's 

* let's write a program that given a list of grades counts the number 
of grades corresponding to a B 
    * scores greater than or equal to 80 and less than 90 correspond to B

    ```python
    grades = [89,100,70,45,76,84,93,81,36,99,79]

    # FINISH THIS CODE 

    ```
    
--

    ```python
    grades = [89,100,70,45,76,84,93,81,36,99,79]
    count = 0
    for grade in grades: 
        if grade < 90 and grade >= 80 :
            count = count + 1
    print (count) 
    ```
    
---
# changing values of the list 

* consider the following code, what do you think it should do? 

    ```python
    mylist = [10, 20, 30]
    for num in mylist:
        num = num * 2 
    print (num) 
    ```
    
--

* you might expect that the list gets changed to `[20, 40, 60]`, 
__but that is not the case__

* the above code does not change the list at all, the only changes are made
to the target variable 

--

* to change the content of the list, we need to access its elements using 
an index for the elements that should be modfied 

.left-column2[
```python
mylist = [10, 20, 30]
for index in range(3):
    mylist[index] = mylist[index] * 2 
print (num) 
```
]
.right-column2[
or
```python
mylist = [10, 20, 30]
for index in range( len(mylist) ):
    mylist[index] = mylist[index] * 2 
print (num) 
```
]

---
# write a program: change the list

* Given the following list of prices, write a program that
modifies the list to include 8% sales tax

    ```python
    prices = [1.99, 2.99, 3.99, 4.99, 5.99, 6.99]
    ```

*  Given the following list of values, write a program that
multiplies the values by 2 if the original value is odd (it should leave 
the even values unchanged) 

    ```python
    values = [12, 32, 17, 5, 12, 11, 19, 0, 1, 6]
    ```

# finding items in the list using __`in`__

- __`in`__ allows us to test if an element is in the list or not


.left-column2[
```python
my_list = ['pie', 'cake', 'pizza']
if 'cake' in my_list:
    print ("I found cake!")
else:
    print ("No cake found.")
```

output: 
```
I found cake
```

my_list = ['pie', 'cake', 'pizza']
if 'candy' in my_list:
    print ("I found candy!")
else:
    print ("No candy found.")
```

output: 
```
No candy found. 
```

* try it yourself:
    * given these two lists:
    
        ```
        a = [1,2,3,4,5]
        b = [2,3,10,11,12,1]
        ```
    * write a program that finds all elements that exist in both lists
        (i.e. the integer 2 exists in both lists) 
    * store your result in a list and print it out to the user

# adding/appending items to a list 

* we have already seen a few ways in which we can add items to
lists:
    * repeat the list using the `*` operator
    * concatenate the list using the `+` operator

* another way to add items to a list is to use the __`append()`__ method
    * this function is part of the list data type
    * it adds new element at __the end__ of the list 
    
* example 
    ```python
    mylist = ['Christine', 'Jasmine', 'Renee']
    mylist.append('Kate')
    print (mylist)
    ```
    output:
    ```
    ['Christine', 'Jasmine', 'Renee', 'Kate']
    ```
--

* notice that the `append()` function is called using the __dot operator__ - this 
operator is used to __call a function on__ a list 

---
# sorting list elements 

* we can have Python sort items in a list using the __`sort()`__ function 

* example:

    ```python
    my_list = ['pie', 'cake', 'pizza']

    my_list.append('apple')
    print (my_list)

    my_list.sort()
    print (my_list)
    ```
    output: 

    ```
    ['pie', 'cake', 'pizza', 'apple']
    ['apple', 'cake', 'pie', 'pizza']
    ```
    
---
# write a program: sorted names

* write a program that prompts the user for a sequence of names and then
prints them in an alphabetical order 

* the user should enter "none" to indicate the last value was entered

* the program should store the names in a list and then print the sorted
list of all the names entered 




---
# finding the position of an item in the list

* we can use the __`index()`__ function to ask Python to tell us the index of an
item in a list

* the `index()` function takes one argument - an element to search for -
and returns an integer value of where that element can be found. 

* warning: the `index()` function will cause an error if it cannot find the
item in the list

* example:

```python
my_list = ['pizza', 'pie', 'cake']

if 'pie' in my_list:
    location = my_list.index('pie')
    print ('pie is at postion #', location)
else:
    print ('there is no pie!')
```

---
# write a program: find the price

* given that the following lists match up with one another (i.e.
the product at the first position of the products list matches
the price at the first position in the prices list), write a
product price lookup program

    ```
    products = ['peanut butter', 'jelly', 'bread']
    prices = [3.99, 2.99, 1.99]
    ```

* the user should be prompted for the product name

* if the product exists, its price should be printed back

* if the product does not exist, the message "we do not have ..." should be
printed (the ... should be replaced by the name of the requested product) 

* (feel free to extend the list to make the program more interesting)

---
# finding smallest and largest 

*  Python has two built in functions that let us get the highest
and lowest values in a list
    
    * __`min()`__ 
    
    * __`max()`__
    
* example:

    ```python
    prices = [2,59, 3.99, 2.99, 7.99, 1.99, 14.95, 3.17, 4.55]
    biggest = max(prices)
    smallest = min(prices)
    print (smallest, 'up to', biggest)
    ```

---
# removing elements from a list 

* we can remove an item from a list by using the __`remove`__ function 

* example:

    ```python
    prices = [3.99, 2.99, 1.99]
    prices.remove(2.99)
    print (prices)
    ```

* warning: trying to remove an element that is not in a list will result
in an error

- ask the user for 5 colors but don't allow duplicate values
(i.e., your code has to reject duplicates if the user enters
them)

- sort the colors in alphabetical order

- print the sorted list 



---

# grades


Write a program that asks the user to continually enter in the following
information for a group of students who just completed their first exam:
- name
- grade received 
Save that information in a list. 
To indicate the end of the list, the user will enter "none" for the name and "-1" 
for the grade. 

Calculate and print the following information based on the data (use the list
functions discussed in these slides):

- number of students who took the exam
- average grade on the exam 
- lowest grade on the exam
- the name of the student who received the lowest grade
- highest grade on the exam  
- the name of the student who received the highest grade
- standard deviation of the grades on the exam 
- median of the grades on the exam 

Extra challenge:
- print the names and grades sorted alphabetically by student names
