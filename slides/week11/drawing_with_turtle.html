would you change your answer if: 

- ... it turned out that it is generated by a computer program? 

- ... you could write a program that does exactly the same drawing? 

- ... it was based on a mathematical function?

In this blog post in Scientific American [_Making Mathematical Art_](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/making-mathematical-art/) Hamid 
Naderi Yeganeh introduces us to the art of fractals and showcases several of his own works. 

More of his artwork can be found at [Mathematical Art by Hamid 
Naderi Yeganeh](https://mathematics.culturalspot.org/home)

# Turtle graphics basics 
]

# first Turtle graphics program 

```python

# Step 1: Make all the "turtle" commands available to us.
import turtle

# Step 2: Create a new turtle. We'll call it "bob"
bob = turtle.Turtle()

# Step 3: Move in the direction Bob's facing for 50 pixels
bob.forward(50)

# Step 4: We're done!
turtle.done()
```

* what changes should we make to draw a 
    * triangle
    * pentagon
    * hexagon

* can we write a program with a single variable that controls the number of sides 
(do that changing that one value changes what the program does)?

# documentation 
###(i.e., where to learn more) 

- To learn from the documentation for the turtle package
you can use the official Python3 documentation:
    https://docs.python.org/3.2/library/turtle.html

- There are some good examples (like the one below) and detailed
descriptions of all of the functions

```python 
# https://trinket.io/python/ce301e7e94

import turtle

bob = turtle.Turtle(); 
bob.speed(0)
bob.color('red', 'yellow')
bob.begin_fill()
for i in range(37):
    bob.forward(200)
    bob.left(170)
bob.end_fill()
bob.done()
```

### drawing plots of sin() and cos() functions 

```python
# https://trinket.io/python/d4c8bc7dcf
 
import math
import turtle

# resize the screen for drawing of trigonometric funtions 
wn = turtle.Screen()
wn.setworldcoordinates(-1,-2,8,2)

#setup the turtle to draw the sin() function
fred = turtle.Turtle()
fred.pencolor('green')
fred.shape("turtle")
fred.penup()

#setup the turtle to draw the cos() function
jack = turtle.Turtle()
jack.pencolor('blue')
jack.shape("turtle")
jack.penup()

#draw the two functions 
for x in range(360):
    x = math.radians(x)
    y1 = math.sin(x)
    y2 = math.cos(x)
    fred.goto(x, y1)
    jack.goto(x, y2)
    fred.pendown()
    jack.pendown()
```
