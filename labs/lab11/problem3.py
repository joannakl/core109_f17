Snake Eyes

Write a program that simulates rolling 2 6-sided dice repeatedly. 
The goal is to keep rolling until the result on both dice is 1 (snake eyes). 
The program should count the number of rolls it took to get snake eyes.

WARNING: it may take a long time for this program to finish sometimes

-------------
Here is a sample run of the program: 

3        4
1        3
2        2
3        2
1        6
1        6
4        5
4        2
2        3
5        1
3        2
1        1

12  rolls to snake eyes
