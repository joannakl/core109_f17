Write a program that plays a lottery.
The user is asked to pick 4 numbers for the game. 
The numbers should be between 1 and 10 (your program should verify this). 

The program should generate its own list of 4 random lucky numbers and it
should display the results that state how many out of the lucky numbers
the user got. 

----
Here are some sample runs of the program:

Pick four numbers from 1 to 100 as your lottery choices.

Enter your number 1: 9

Enter your number 2: 8

Enter your number 3: 7

Enter your number 4: 6

CONGRATULATIONS: you picked 3 of the four lucky numbers: [9, 1, 7, 8]    
 

-- 

Pick four numbers from 1 to 100 as your lottery choices.

Enter your number 1: 1

Enter your number 2: 6

Enter your number 3: 3

Enter your number 4: 8

CONGRATULATIONS: you picked 1 of the four lucky numbers: [4, 8, 8, 2]     
 

--
