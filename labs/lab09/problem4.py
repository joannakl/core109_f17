Write a program that performs the Dale-Chall Readability Test on a given text. 

Recall that for this test you will need 
* the list of 3000 'easy' words
* the total number of words in the text
* the total number of sentences in the text 

(See this week's slides for the formula.)

You can read the file containing all of the easy words at 
https://joannakl.github.io/core109_f17/slides/week10/easy_words.txt

The program below starts with several url's for books. 
Your program should run with one of those url's at a time. 
(Feel free to add your own as well.)  


==============
Sample runs for this program are not provided.
Depending on how you process your text, the results might be slightly 
different.    


==============

__COMMENT YOUR SOURCE CODE__ by 

* briefly describing parts of your program 
* including your name at the top of your
  file (above these instructions)
