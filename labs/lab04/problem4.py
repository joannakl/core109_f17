A salesperson has a base salary of $1000.00 per month plus the bonus of 
20% of all the sales. Write a program that can be used to calculate the 
total monthly salary as a function of the sales made. Your program should 
display a ”table” that shows the monthly salary for different amount of 
sales made. 
The amounts of sales should vary from $1,000 to $10,000 in increments of $500.
This program is NOT interactive (i.e., it does not take any input from the user).
 
 
   
==============
Output of this program should look as follows:
(Note: you do not need to worry about displaying the amounts with exactly
two decimal places.)
