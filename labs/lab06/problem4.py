Write a program that asks the user to continually enter student grades. 

To indicate the end of the list, the user will enter "-1" 
for the grade. 

Your program should validate that the grades are within a valid range of 0 to 100. 

Calculate the following information based on the data:

- number of students who took the exam

- average grade on the exam 

- lowest grade on the exam

- highest grade on the exam  




==============
Here are a few sample runs of your program:
    
Enter the grades one at a time. Enter -1 to indicate the end.

next grade: 90

next grade: -7
invalid score, not counted

next grade: 70

next grade: 85

next grade: -1

 ----------
number of grades:  3
average score:     81.66666666666667
lowest score:      70
highest score:     90

===

Enter the grades one at a time. Enter -1 to indicate the end.

next grade: -1

 ----------
number of grades:  0
