Write a program that asks the user to enter a positive odd integer. If the 
user does not, they should be re-prompted for a correct value.

The program should calculate the sum of all the odd numbers between 0 and
the value provided by the user.

USE THE WHILE LOOP! 



==============
Here are a few sample runs of your program:
    
Enter a positive odd integer: 15
The sum of all the odd numbers from 0 to 15 is 64

--

Enter a positive odd integer: 64

Sorry, this is not a valid value. Try again: 65
The sum of all the odd numbers from 0 to 65 is 1089

==============
