Write a program that uses Turtle graphics to produce one of the drawings of 
Hamid Naderi Yeganeh. You can pick any of the drawings, but it should not be
the one from the slides. For best results, you can use the Trinket.io https://trinket.io/python 
website and just include the link in your submission. 


You can read more about the artwork and the artist at
