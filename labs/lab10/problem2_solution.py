Create your own drawing using Turtle graphics.
The drawing can be anything you wish, but the program has to use the following 
components:
    - use a loop 
    - use colors for drawing
Restriction: your drawing can be based on one of the drawings in the slides, but 
it cannot be identical to one of the drawings in the slides. It has to be your
own creation.

__COMMENT YOUR SOURCE CODE__ by 

* briefly describing parts of your program
