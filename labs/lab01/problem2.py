Programs rarely just perform a task without any user interaction. They usually
ask user questions or allow the user to make choices by using menues, clicking
buttons and entering information.

In Python programs, we use `input` function to obtain information from the user.

Run this program and answer the questions below.


"""

name = input("Hello! What is your name? ");
print ("Hi " + name + "! It is lovely to meet you!\n");

num_of_programs_written = input ("How many programs have you written in your life? ")
print ("Wow " + num_of_programs_written + "!!!")
print ("In this class you will write close to 100 programs.")
