Welcome to Lab 01 exercises.

The exercises that you complete in this lab will give you a taste of programming.
You will read and write programs in Python - the programming language that we
will be learning this semester. You do not need to install any software to complete
this lab assignment. You need a computer with Internet access (either your personal
computer or any NYU public lab computer).

Follow the instructions in that file to complete the first exercise. Once done,
continue with the remaining problems in order.
