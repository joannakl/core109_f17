Write a program for a simple calculator. 

* Ask the user for two numbers.  You can assume they will be floating point numbers.
  (This should use the input() function and the float() function.)

* Compute the following and print it out (using print() function). 
  Display the mathematical expression and the result

    * The sum of the numbers
    * The product of the numbers
    * The difference between the numbers
    * The first number divided by the second number
    * The first number raised to the power of the second number

You should use variables to store the values entered by the user.

Example Output - Everything after the greater than sign (>) is user input
(you will not see the > in the program, they are just here to indicate what is
printed by the program and what is entered by the user):

Enter the first number
> 8.0
Enter the second number 
> 2.0

8.0 + 2.0 = 10.0
8.0 * 2.0 = 16.0
8.0 - 2.0 = 6.0
8.0 / 2.0 = 4.0
8.0 ^ 2.0 = 64.0
