Write a program that:

* asks the user for their three favorite vegetables
* uses the print() function three times (only three times) to 
    * print out every vegetable separated by commas, in the order entered
    * print out every vegetable again, in reverse order, each on a separate line
    * print out every vegetable again, in reverse order, each on a separate line
