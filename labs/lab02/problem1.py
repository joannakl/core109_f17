All programs should have their authors clearly identified. 
Add your name above to indicate that you are the author of this 
program. If you are working with a parner, list them as your
co-authors. 

From Wikipedia:
"ASCII art is a graphic design technique that uses computers for 
presentation and consists of pictures pieced together from the 95 printable 
characters defined by the ASCII Standard."
So ASCII art is a way of producing "drawing" using characters. 
Here is an example of a tree drawing: 

   /\
   ""
  /""\ 
  """"
 /""""\
 """""" 
   ||
 
Write a program that uses the print() function multiple times to produce 
a simple ASCII art graphic. 

WARNING: do not spend too much time coming up with a fancy design!
(this tends to be addictive, but you have a few other problems to work on).
