Write a program that calculates the sum and average of elements stored in 
a given list of numbers.


The program below has a few definitions of specific lists called numbers
but your program should work even if the code is edited to change the 
content of that list to an arbitrary list of numbers. 

Restriction: you cannot use the sum() function that was mentioned in class. You have to
use a loop to calculate the sum of the values stored in the list. 



==============
Here are a few sample runs of your program:
    
list: [1, -3, 5, -17, 13, 72, -98, 615]
sum:  588
avg:  73.5

--
    
list: [3, 5, 15, -8, 43, 78, -9]
sum:  127
avg:  18.142857142857142

--
    
list: [-99, -96, -93, -90, -87, -84, -81, -78, -75, -72, -69, -66, -63, -60, -57, -54, -51, -48, -45, -42, -39, -36, -33, -30, -27, -24, -21, -18, -15, -12, -9, -6, -3, 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48, 51, 54, 57, 60, 63, 66, 69, 72, 75, 78, 81, 84, 87, 90, 93, 96, 99]
sum:  0
avg:  0.0

__COMMENT YOUR SOURCE CODE__ by 

* briefly describing parts of your program
