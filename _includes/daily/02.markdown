**Starting with Python (due Sept. 13 at 11:55pm)**

Note: *if you joined the class late or if you did not , follow the steps to create your account on `PythonAnywhere` (see the assignments for class #1).* 

---

The exercises that you complete in this lab will give you a taste of programming.
You will read and write programs in Python - the programming language that we
will be learning this semester. You do not need to install any software to complete
this lab assignment. You need a computer with Internet access (either your personal
computer or any NYU public lab computer).


- Login to your `PythonAnywhere` account (use a separate tab in the browser so
that you can switch back and forth between this page and the `PythonAnywhere` 
page). 
- Switch to the `Files` tab and under `Directories` create a new directory
called `lab01`. This creates a new directory and switches to that directory. 
- Under the `Files` create a new file called `problem1.py`. This creates a new
file and brings you to the code editor. 
- Use the `problem1.py` link below. Copy the entire text of the problem and paste it
in the editor on `PythonAnywhere`. Complete the tasks in problem 1 and answer the
questions. 
- Repeat the last step for all five problems. 


__Problems for this lab:__
- [problem1.py](labs/lab01/problem01.py)
- [problem2.py](labs/lab01/problem02.py)
- [problem3.py](labs/lab01/problem03.py)
- [problem4.py](labs/lab01/problem04.py)
- [problem5.txt](labs/lab01/problem05.txt)


<!--

- Complete the problems listed there in `lab01` folder. The final versions
(i.e., the ones that will be graded) should be there no later than the due date of
Sept. 13 at 11:55pm.
