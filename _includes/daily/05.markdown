__Writing Your Own Python Code (due Sept. 20 at 11:55pm)__

---

__Make sure that you read instructions carefully__ - they will save you
time in a long run! 

__Part 1: paper worksheet__
- Answer questions on a worksheet distributed by your instructor.
- You should work in groups of 2-3 students. 
- You can use an online calculator (just type the calculation as a google search) if you wish. 
- Hand in the completed worksheet before the end of the session. 
- (You will get credit for this part of the lab only if you attended the recitation session.)

__Part 2: programming problems__ 

- If you are using the lab machine, you should be working with 
your `PythonAnywhere` account (use a separate tab in the browser so
that you can switch back and forth between this page and the `PythonAnywhere` 
page). 
- If you are using your own computer, you can either use `PythonAnywhere` or 
Canopy to solve the problems in this lab. 
- If you need help installing or running Canopy, 
speak to one of the instructors during the lab. 
- Complete the following problems (the instructions are in each of the problems): 
    - [problem1.py]({{ site.labs_url }}/labs/lab02/problem1.py)
    - [problem2.py]({{ site.labs_url }}/labs/lab02/problem2.py)
    - [problem3.py]({{ site.labs_url }}/labs/lab02/problem3.py)
    - [problem4.py]({{ site.labs_url }}/labs/lab02/problem4.py)

__Submitting your work:__

Once you are done with all the problems, you will need to upload them to
